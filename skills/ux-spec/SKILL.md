<!-- CANONICAL:BANNER:BEGIN -->
> **CRITICAL:** (1) Do NOT commit ANY changes (no `git add`, no `git commit`, no `git push`) unless EXPLICITLY instructed by the user. (2) This is a leaf skill. You MUST NOT spawn sub-agents, invoke `Skill()` recursively, or use `Agent()`, `TeamCreate`, `TeamDelete`, or `SendMessage`. The calling agent handles peer messaging after this skill returns.

# UX Spec — Author a UX Design Spec

You are the **UX Spec Author**. You produce a single UX design spec at
`docs/ux/{slug}.md` and return. The calling agent (typically `@ux-designer`) drafts
the content; this skill is the format authority — section list, frontmatter contract,
output path, and collision handling all live here.

## Argument Handling

<!-- CANONICAL:ARGUMENT_HANDLING:BEGIN -->
The argument is a single positional `<topic>` (free-text, 3-10 words describing the
artifact). No flags, no other args.

If `<topic>` is missing or empty:

```
Error: Usage: Skill({TYPE}, "<topic>") — describe the artifact in 3-10 words.
```

If extra positional args are passed beyond `<topic>`, ignore them silently.

**Slug derivation** (deterministic):

1. `lower      = lowercase(topic)`
2. `cleaned    = re.sub(r'[^a-z0-9]+', '-', lower)`
3. `trimmed    = cleaned.strip('-')`
4. `truncated  = trimmed[:60]`
5. Prefer a word boundary in [40, 60): `boundary = truncated.rfind('-', 40, 60)`. If
   `boundary != -1`, set `truncated = truncated[:boundary]`.
6. `truncated  = truncated.strip('-')` (re-trim after step 5).
7. If `truncated == ""`, ABORT: `Error: Topic must contain at least one alphanumeric character.`
8. Use `truncated` as `{slug}`.
<!-- CANONICAL:ARGUMENT_HANDLING:END -->

For this skill, substitute `{TYPE}` with `ux-spec` in the usage error.

## When to Use

- A UX design spec is needed for a user-facing surface (CLI, TUI, API, agent prompt,
  config format, doc structure) and should land at `docs/ux/{slug}.md` as the
  authoritative design record.
- The calling agent (typically `@ux-designer`) is producing a design spec per
  Responsibility 1 of the agent prompt (`agents/ux-designer.md`).
- A new or significantly revised user-facing surface needs design guidance before
  implementation — wireframes, interaction flows, error states, accessibility.

## When NOT to Use

<!-- COUPLING: this skill is part of the doc-authoring family. The "When NOT to Use" delegation routes below MUST stay in sync with skills/prd, tdd, adr, and specs — update all 5 in lockstep when adding/removing a sibling skill. Also bridges the report-emission family (design-review, design-qa) which brackets the ux-spec lifecycle — keep those routes accurate too. -->
- Inline advisory replies, design review comments, scratch wireframes, or one-off
  copy proposals that are not meant to live at `docs/ux/`.
- Internal-only surfaces (agent-to-agent protocols, internal scripts, build
  tooling without external users), single-tier design fits (CLI flag rename,
  copy tweak, one-shot error message), or work that fits the calling agent's
  Design Output Tiers 1–3 (`agents/ux-designer.md` Responsibility 1) — use the
  appropriate lighter tier instead. Full UX specs are reserved for Tier 4
  (new interaction pattern, multi-surface, core workflow change,
  precedent-setting).
- Peer review of a draft UX spec or design proposal (no file written, report into
  the calling agent's context): use `Skill(design-review, "<scope>")`.
- QA of shipped implementation against an accepted UX spec (no file written, report
  into the calling agent's context): use `Skill(design-qa, "<scope>")`.
- Technical Design Documents (architecture/system design): use
  `Skill(tdd, "<topic>")`.
- Architecture Decision Records (single decisions): use `Skill(adr, "<topic>")`.
- Product Requirements Documents (feature-level specs): use
  `Skill(prd, "<topic>")`.
- Project-wide engineering specs (architecture, security, operations, performance,
  code-quality, review-strategy, testing): owned by the `specs` skill.

## Pre-flight

1. **Resolve `{slug}`** from `<topic>` per the Argument Handling slug rule above.
2. **Resolve `{output_path}`** as `docs/ux/{slug}.md`. The output directory is
   `docs/ux/`.
3. **Resolve context**:
   - `{today_date}` = `Bash date +%Y-%m-%d`.
   - `{project_name}` = `Bash basename $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)`.
   - `{updated_by}` = the calling agent's identifier (e.g., `@ux-designer`).
4. **Check collision**: `Glob docs/ux/{slug}.md`. If a file exists at
   `{output_path}`, run the COLLISION_DIALOG below.

<!-- CANONICAL:COLLISION_DIALOG:BEGIN -->
If a file already exists at the target output path, invoke `AskUserQuestion`:

```
AskUserQuestion(
  header: "File exists",
  question: "{output_path} already exists. How should I proceed?",
  options: [
    {label: "Pick new slug",
     description: "I'll suggest {slug}-2 (or you can supply a new topic)"},
    {label: "Overwrite",
     description: "Replace the existing file (destructive — uncommitted changes will be lost)"},
    {label: "Cancel",
     description: "Stop without writing"}
  ]
)
```

- "Pick new slug" → suggest `{slug}-2`, then `{slug}-3`, etc. via free-text follow-up.
- "Overwrite" → proceed to Authoring Procedure; the existing file will be replaced on Write.
- "Cancel" → emit `Cancelled — no file written.` and end.

Never silently overwrite. There is no "append" option — partial appends produce
malformed frontmatter.
<!-- CANONICAL:COLLISION_DIALOG:END -->

## Authoring Procedure

1. **Gather prior art**: `Grep -r "{topic-keywords}" docs/` (broader than the
   pre-flight scan — include `docs/spec/`, `docs/tdd/`, `docs/ux/`). Read any
   adjacent specs that touch the same surface or terminology — the new UX spec
   should reference, not contradict, prior accepted UX specs and design tokens
   (per `agents/ux-designer.md`: same concept gets the same name across all surfaces).
2. **Draft the frontmatter** per the Required Frontmatter contract below. UX specs
   use `maturity` (not `status`); new specs start at `maturity: "draft"`.
3. **Draft each Required Section in order** (see Output Contract → Required
   Sections). Every section listed MUST appear, in the order shown. Match spec
   fidelity to problem complexity — sections that do not apply to the surface
   type (e.g., visual design for a CLI flag, internationalization for a
   server-side log format, accessibility for a non-interactive config schema) may
   contain a single `N/A.` paragraph with a one-line justification, but omitting
   them is a defect.
4. **Mermaid diagrams**: the Mermaid Mandate is **mandatory** for UX specs (per
   `agents/ux-designer.md`). Include at least one Mermaid block — a user flow,
   state transition, or cross-surface journey. ASCII wireframes are encouraged
   alongside Mermaid but do not replace it.
5. **Propose actual copy**: per `agents/ux-designer.md` content design rule, propose
   real button labels, error messages (what happened → why → what to do), empty
   states, and tooltips. No placeholder strings. The same concept gets the same
   name across all surfaces. **When the calling agent must resolve copy or layout
   variants with the operator before save, prefer `AskUserQuestion` with the
   `preview` field** (CLI mockup, ASCII wireframe, or copy variants) so the
   operator can compare alternatives visually rather than from prose descriptions.
6. **Cover error branches**: every workflow in Interaction Design includes its
   error and recovery branches. Edge Cases & Error States enumerates empty,
   overloaded, degraded, and concurrent states.
7. **Resolve open questions before save**: per `agents/ux-designer.md`, no
   unresolved questions ship with the spec. There is no dedicated Open Questions
   section — entries belong inside §9 Handoff Notes and must be resolved (or the
   calling agent re-invokes this skill after consulting peers and the operator).

## Output Contract

### Required Frontmatter

```yaml
---
project: "{project_name}"
maturity: "draft"
last_updated: "{today_date}"
updated_by: "{updated_by}"
scope: "{one-liner describing what the UX spec covers}"
owner: "{owning agent or team, e.g. @ux-designer}"
dependencies:
  - {relative path to related TDD/PRD/UX doc, or empty list}
---
```

Field rules:

- `project` = `basename $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)`.
- `maturity` is the doc-class ladder
  (`proof-of-concept | draft | experimental | stable`). New UX specs start at
  `draft`. **UX specs do NOT have a `status` field** — workflow state is tracked
  via `maturity`. (Doc-family convention: PRDs and UX specs use `maturity`
  only — they are living definitions, not vote-gated workflow artifacts. TDDs
  use both. ADRs use `status` only.)
- `last_updated` is ISO date `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `updated_by` is the calling agent identifier (`@ux-designer`, etc.).
- `scope` is a one-line description of what the doc covers — populated by the
  calling agent.
- `owner` is the responsible agent or team handle.
- `dependencies` is a YAML array of related-file paths (relative to the doc); use
  `[]` if none.

### Required Sections

The UX spec body MUST contain these top-level sections, in this order. Each is a
`##` heading in the drafted document. The list mirrors `agents/ux-designer.md`
Responsibility 1 design spec format.

1. **Overview** — surface type, users (skill/context/frequency), key workflows
   (3-5 prioritized), success criteria (concrete, testable), success metrics
   (quantitative).
2. **Information Architecture** — user-facing data model,
   navigation/discoverability, information hierarchy.
3. **Layout & Structure** — wireframes/structure adapted to surface (ASCII for
   TUI, command tree for CLI, schemas for API, file tree for doc structures).
4. **Interaction Design** — user flows with error branches, input patterns,
   feedback patterns, perceived performance, keyboard/shortcut map, destructive
   action confirmation.
5. **Visual & Sensory Design** — semantic color palette, typography hierarchy,
   spacing/density, motion (where it aids comprehension), terminal constraints.
6. **Edge Cases & Error States** — empty states, error states, overloaded states
   (10K+ items), degraded states (network/permissions), concurrency.
7. **Accessibility** — keyboard navigation, screen reader semantics, color
   independence, motion sensitivity, terminal accessibility.
8. **Internationalization / Privacy / Measurement** — scale to project: i18n (text
   expansion, RTL, locale), data minimization (inventory, consent, display),
   metrics (instrumentation points, iteration triggers).
9. **Handoff Notes** — the bridge to @project-manager (decomposition) and
   @senior-engineer (implementation). MUST include: (a) component / surface
   breakdown with proposed file or module scoping where known, AND a per-component
   implementation priority (P0/P1/P2 or MVP/polish) so @project-manager can
   sequence Docket issues without re-deriving the order; (b) MVP cutline
   versus polish priorities; (c) resolved design decisions with one-line
   rationale; (d) cross-spec dependencies (TDDs, PRDs, sibling UX specs); (e)
   recommended follow-on research, instrumentation, or usability validation
   the calling agent cannot run. Vague entries ("see TDD", "TBD") are a defect.

### Mermaid Mandate

Mermaid is **required** for every UX spec — at least one block showing a user
flow, state transition, or cross-surface journey. Acceptable block fences are
` ```mermaid ` (lowercase, no space). This mandate is mandatory per
`agents/ux-designer.md`; UX specs do not have the pure-policy override available
to TDDs and ADRs.

For non-GUI surfaces (CLI flag, API endpoint, config schema, log format), a
cross-surface journey (e.g., `cli invocation → API call → persisted config`) or
an input/output state machine satisfies the mandate. Single-action CLIs without
state should diagram the surrounding workflow, not the action itself.

## Validation Before Save

Before invoking `Write`, verify in the calling agent's context:

1. **Frontmatter fields** — all of `project`, `maturity`, `last_updated`,
   `updated_by`, `scope`, `owner`, `dependencies` present and non-empty
   (`dependencies` may be the empty list `[]`).
2. **No `status` field** — UX specs use `maturity`, not `status`. Presence of a
   `status` field is a defect.
3. **Maturity value** — `maturity` is one of
   `proof-of-concept | draft | experimental | stable`.
4. **Section order** — the body contains all top-level sections enumerated
   in "Required Sections" above, as `##` headings, in the order listed
   (currently 9 sections). Off-by-one against the count is a defect.
5. **Mermaid presence** — at least one ` ```mermaid ` fenced block in the body.
6. **Placeholder scan** — body contains no literal `{slug}`, `{topic}`,
   `{project_name}`, `TBD`, or `TODO` text outside of code-fenced examples.

If any check fails, ABORT (no fix-and-retry — `Edit` is excluded from this
skill's tools):

```
Error: validation failed: {field/section} — {detail}.
```

The calling agent fixes the issue in its own context (it has its own tools)
and re-invokes `Skill(ux-spec, "<topic>")`.

## Save & Return

<!-- CANONICAL:SAVE_AND_RETURN:BEGIN -->
After Validation Before Save passes:

1. `Bash mkdir -p {output_dir}` (idempotent).
2. `Write {output_path}` with the drafted content.
3. Emit a single confirmation line:

   ```
   Created {output_path}
   ```

End. Do NOT echo the file body, do NOT send peer messages, do NOT invoke other skills.
The calling agent owns next steps (vote requests, decomposition, peer notification).

On any abort during Authoring Procedure, Pre-flight, or Validation Before Save: emit
`Error: {one-line cause}` and end without writing.

On operator Cancel during the collision dialog: emit
`Cancelled — no file written.` and end without writing.
<!-- CANONICAL:SAVE_AND_RETURN:END -->

## Failure Modes

| Trigger | Handling |
|---|---|
| `<topic>` missing or empty | Abort: `Error: Usage: Skill(ux-spec, "<topic>") — describe the artifact in 3-10 words.` |
| Slug empty after sanitization (e.g., all-CJK or all-punct topic) | Abort: `Error: Topic must contain at least one alphanumeric character.` |
| Output file already exists | Run COLLISION_DIALOG; never silently overwrite. On Cancel: `Cancelled — no file written.` |
| Operator chooses "Pick new slug" but supplies an empty topic | Re-prompt up to 3 times; on third empty answer, abort: `Error: Could not derive a non-empty slug.` |
| Validation Before Save fails | Abort with `Error: validation failed: {field/section} — {detail}.` No retry — calling agent re-invokes. |
| Required section missing or out of order | Abort: `Error: validation failed: section §N — Required section '{name}' missing or out of order. UX specs require all sections enumerated in Required Sections, in the listed order.` |
| Frontmatter contains `status` field | Abort: `Error: validation failed: frontmatter — UX specs use 'maturity', not 'status'. Remove the status field.` |
| Mermaid mandate not satisfied | Abort: `Error: validation failed: Mermaid block missing — UX specs require at least one mermaid fenced block (user flow, state transition, or cross-surface journey).` |
| Filesystem write fails (permissions, disk, read-only mount) | Surface raw error: `Error: Write failed — {raw error}.` Do NOT retry. The calling agent reports to the operator. |
| Caller passes additional positional args beyond `<topic>` | Ignore extras silently. |
