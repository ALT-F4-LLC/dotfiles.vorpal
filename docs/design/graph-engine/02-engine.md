# 02 — Engine semantics

Status: approved — 2026-08-02. This document defines *what the engine means*; 06 defines the surface
after the ratified boundary (01 §6, third pass): **Docket core carries the whole
workflow engine, designed domain-neutrally** — runs, steps, artifacts, gates, leases,
workflows, typed payloads, events — while Erik's domain content (node contracts,
fragments, prompt formatting, workflow/policy instances, reconcile arithmetic) rides on
top as hash-pinned config, trusted actions, and harness data. "The engine" below means
Docket core. Terms defined here are used verbatim in 03–07.

## 1. Entity model

Six entities defined below (run, issue, step, artifact, gate result, event — issue exists
today, artifact generalizes today's doc), plus Docket's existing proposal/vote entities,
retained unchanged and driven as gates (§6). Workflow definitions are registered, versioned
objects (`docket workflow register`); node contracts, fragments, and policy are repo
files hash-pinned per run at activation via generic file pins — core versions them
without knowing what they are.

```
run 1──* issue 1──* step *──* artifact
              │         │
              │         └──* gate-result
              └──* relation (depends_on | blocks | relates_to | duplicates | parent)
policy, pipeline-def: versioned config, referenced by id@version from runs/steps
event: append-only log of every transition above
```

### 1.1 Run

The unit of "Erik asked for something." Holds the request text, a reference to the plan
artifact, status, the policy version and pipeline versions pinned at activation, and the
ledger rollup (tokens, cost, wall-clock, attempts) that 08's measurement plan reads.

Run status: `planning → active ⇄ waiting-human → done | abandoned`. `paused` is
`waiting-human` with a recorded reason — by policy (budget breach, attempts exhausted,
gate anomaly) or by the operator (`docket run pause`).

### 1.2 Issue (exists today; two additions)

Issues remain the human-facing work items (DKT-N, kind, priority, labels, parent,
relations, comments, files). Two additions:

- **scope** — a list of path globs the issue's implementation is expected to touch.
  Declared by the planner (a judgment, so it may be wrong); *used* deterministically by
  the scheduler for mutual exclusion (§5) and *checked* deterministically by a gate
  (diff-outside-scope ⇒ gate fail ⇒ replan). A wrong guess degrades to a caught error,
  never a race.
- **pipeline binding** — resolved at activation from the issue's kind + labels via the
  pipeline definitions (§4). Recorded on the issue so the binding is inspectable.

The work DAG is issues + `depends_on` relations, exactly as Docket models it today.
`plan` (topological phases) and `next` (ready set) remain the scheduling core.

### 1.3 Step

The unit of execution — one node invocation or one deterministic action, belonging to an
issue (or to the run itself for run-level steps like planning and final review). Steps are
what the conductor spawns and what leases, budgets, and telemetry attach to.

Fields: id (STEP-N), run, issue, node type for LLM steps or a step type
∈ {`action`, `human`, `vote`} for engine steps (`action` = a named deterministic
computation, e.g. `findings-reconcile`; matching the pipeline TOML's `type=`/`action=`
keys, 05 §1), sequence info from the pipeline, status, inputs (artifact refs), outputs
(artifact refs), lease {owner, expires_at}, attempt / max_attempts, model requested /
resolved, effort, tokens, cost, duration.

Step status machine (every transition CAS-guarded and event-logged):

```
pending ──ready──> ready ──claim──> claimed ──start──> running ──record──> gated
   ▲                 ▲                                    │                  │
   │                 └──lease expiry / executor death─────┘         gates run by engine
   │                                                                 │           │
   └────────── new attempt (attempt++ < max) ──────────── fail ◄──gate fail   gate pass
                                                            │                  │
                                              attempts exhausted               ▼
                                                            ▼                done
                                                     waiting-human
skipped: reachable from pending when the pipeline's condition for the step is false
superseded: terminal; prior-ordinal instances at loop entry (06 §11.3)
failed-routed: terminal record of a fanout sibling routed by on_fail (skip ⇒ skipped)
```

Two panel-hardened notes: once the artifact records, the executor's token retires and
the rest of the saga (`gated` onward) is engine-owned — resumed lazily by any engine
invocation, no lease required; and read verbs always render *effective* status (lease
expiry computed at read), so state never lies while nobody is scheduling.

`ready` is *computed*, never stored as intent: a step is ready iff its issue's
dependencies are satisfied, its intra-pipeline predecessors are done, its scope conflicts
with no claimed/running step (§5), the run is active, and concurrency + budget headroom
exist (§7). `docket next` returns exactly this set — the entire scheduling decision.

### 1.4 Artifact

Every node output. Markdown body + metadata: id (ART-N), run, producer step, kind
(free-form string: `plan`, `tdd`, `change-summary`, `findings`, `gap`, …), and an optional
**payload** — a JSON document validated against a registered schema (§6). Artifacts are
immutable; a re-run of a step produces a new artifact. Nodes reference artifacts by id;
briefs (§8) inline their bodies.

Today's `doc` entity (DOC-N, revisions) remains for human-authored, long-lived documents;
artifacts are run-scoped and immutable. 06 §3 discusses sharing storage.

### 1.5 Gate result

The record of one deterministic check: step, gate name, resolved command, exit code,
captured output (stored, truncated with an explicit flag), duration, and the verdict the
policy derived from it. Gate results are facts the engine produced itself, so policies may
branch on them (E-8).

### 1.6 Event

Append-only NDJSON feed of every state transition, claim, gate result, budget increment,
and policy trigger, with monotonic sequence numbers. This is what observers follow
(`docket events --follow`, `board --watch`, exporters), what resume replays (§9), and
what external telemetry (optional Prometheus export, 08) consumes; the relay itself
needs only `next` plus the harness's own completion notifications (03 §3). The activity log Docket has today is the seed;
events generalize it.

## 2. The two-level graph

**Level 1 — the work DAG (judged).** The planner composes it per run: issues with
`depends_on` edges, scopes, kinds, labels, and acceptance criteria in the body. This is a
judgment — what the work *is* — and therefore a model's job (AC-1).

**Level 2 — the process graph (deterministic).** For each issue, the engine expands a
pipeline — the sequence/fan-out of steps that take that issue from promoted to done
(implement → review fan-out → reconcile → verify → gates → close, in the standard case).
Expansion is a pure function of (issue kind, labels, pipeline definitions @ pinned
version). Same issue, same pipeline version ⇒ identical steps, every time (AC-2).

This split is the load-bearing decision of the whole design. The fleet's history shows
the process is the *stable, recurring* part (every issue flowed claim→implement→review→
verify→close, enforced by ~100KB of prose); the work is the *novel* part. The novel part
gets a model; the recurring part gets data.

## 3. Run lifecycle

1. **Intake.** Operator talks to the planner (03 §2). Planner records the request and a
   plan artifact; creates issues + relations + scopes in `backlog`; `run` is `planning`.
2. **Approval (human gate).** Operator reviews `docket plan` / the plan artifact and
   activates: `docket run activate RUN-N`. Activation pins policy + pipeline versions,
   binds pipelines, expands Level-2 steps for phase-1 issues, and promotes them.
   Nothing executes before this gate.
3. **Execution.** Conductor loop (03 §3): `next` → spawn → record → repeat. All
   sequencing, claiming, gating, and branching are engine-computed.
4. **Human gates.** Steps of type `human:*` (plan approval, commit authorization,
   security-waiver, budget-breach review) put the run in `waiting-human`; the conductor
   surfaces them conversationally and stops spawning until resolved (03 §6). Pause
   blocks new claims but honors in-flight completes; abandon revokes live leases.
5. **Completion.** All issues done ⇒ run `done`. The run report (ledger rollup + gate
   summary + artifact index) is generated deterministically: `docket run report`.
   Abandonment is explicit (`docket run abandon`, reason required).

## 4. Pipelines

A pipeline definition is a versioned TOML file in the generic workflow grammar,
registered (`docket workflow register`) and version-pinned per run at activation
(06 §1–§2). It declares, per step: node type (or gate/human), inputs
(by producer step name), fan-out (a list of node types spawned in parallel), attached
gates, `max_attempts`, on-fail routing (one of the *enumerated* deterministic options:
`fix-loop`, `waiting-human`, `skip`, `abandon-issue`), model/effort overrides, and
conditions (predicates over issue kind/labels only). Full format and the standard
pipeline set: 05.

Two properties are load-bearing:

- **Closed vocabulary.** Every branch a pipeline can take is one of the enumerated
  routings. There is no expression language, no scripting, no model call. If a situation
  isn't expressible, the answer is `waiting-human`, not cleverness.
- **Version pinning.** Runs pin pipeline versions at activation; editing a pipeline never
  changes an in-flight run. Reproducibility and safe local change (T7) both fall out.

## 5. Scheduling, claims, and mutual exclusion

**Ready set.** §1.3 defines readiness. `docket next --run RUN-N --json` returns ready
steps with everything the conductor needs to spawn: step id, node type, executor
archetype, model/effort (from policy), and the brief handle (§8).

**Claims are capabilities.** `docket step claim STEP-N` is atomic (single SQLite
transaction, CAS on step version): exactly one claimant wins; losers get `CONFLICT`.
The claim **mints a random capability token** (not derivable from ids), returns it
together with the step's brief (§8), and every subsequent mutating verb — heartbeat,
complete, fail — refuses a caller whose token doesn't match the live lease (AUTH_ERROR).
An executor that never claimed cannot record; a stale one gets STALE_LEASE. TTLs and a
schedule-to-close `max_step_duration` come from `[limits]` per executor class, falling
back to `docket config` defaults (06 §11.1). Reaping a write-class lease holds write
headroom until the relay acknowledges the reap — the DB fence is not a tree fence
(06 §2).

**Leases.** A claim is a lease. Expiry without completion ⇒ the engine returns the step
to `ready` and increments `attempt` — that *is* the liveness mechanism. Executors renew
implicitly: a PostToolUse hook in the executor session runs `docket step heartbeat`
(03 §5), so any tool activity extends the lease; a wedged or dead executor stops
heartbeating and the lease lapses. This retires today's entire liveness doctrine
(probe-once, D1–D3 death evidence, retire-then-replace, dead-man watch scripts).

**Mutual exclusion.** The scheduler never has two claimed/running steps whose issues'
scopes overlap (glob intersection). Overlap ⇒ the later step simply isn't ready yet.
This replaces edit batons and singleton locks with scheduler refusal — mutual exclusion
by construction, not by cooperation. Scope-less issues (docs-only, investigation) declare
`scope = []` and never exclude; a step whose diff escapes its scope fails the scope gate
and routes per pipeline.

**Serialized writers (v1, ratified).** At most one write-archetype step is claimable at
a time — engine-enforced in `next` — because gates computed on a shared mutable tree
race even across disjoint scopes. Read-only fan-outs parallelize freely (the proven
win). Worktree-isolated parallel writes are an optional instance optimization (08 D9),
requiring no semantic change here — single-writer is the always-available baseline.

**Fairness/ordering.** Within the ready set: priority, then oldest-first. The conductor
spawns up to the concurrency budget (§7) and may not reorder (it receives an ordered
list). `docket dispatch open` records the batch manifest; `next` **refuses** while a
dispatch is open or while discrepancies exist (claimed-but-unrecorded past grace,
usage rows missing) — relay drift stalls loudly instead of proceeding around its own
mess. Dispatches carry a TTL (lazily auto-abandoned by `next`) and an explicit
`dispatch abandon` verb, so a crashed relay can never wedge a run (06 §2).

## 6. Deterministic computations over model output

Model output is prose (01 §1's corollary, E-2) with exactly one exception: where the
engine runs arithmetic or threshold logic, the relevant slice of output is a typed
payload.

**Findings.** Review-family nodes attach a `findings` payload: a JSON array of
`{id, title, severity, file, line?, evidence}` with `severity ∈ {info, low, medium,
high, blocker}` — the archetypal sanctioned typed enum (per-AC status is the other),
because code computes over it.
Everything else a judge wants to say lives in the markdown body.

**Clustering (judged), reconciliation (computed).** After a review fan-out, a synthesizer
node clusters duplicate findings across judges — that is judgment (E-7's measured
run-to-run variance lives here and is tolerated). Then the builtin `aggregate` action (06 §2 — Erik's reconciliation is its parameters:
field=severity, method=median, hold_spread=2)
computes, deterministically: per-cluster severity = median; clusters with spread ≥ 2
levels are `held` — excluded from automatic routing, and their presence materializes a
`human:held-findings` step the operator resolves (`docket step approve|reject` — the
note records the disposition, e.g. an accepted severity; the reconciled payload is
annotated `operator_resolved` and thresholds re-apply over the resolved set); every
demotion records `demoted_from`. Zero-variance arithmetic, per E-3.

**Verdicts are policy, not prose (T5).** The review step's outcome is computed from the
reconciled set by the pipeline's threshold policy — e.g. standard-change: any `blocker`
or ≥1 `high` in-scope ⇒ route `fix-loop`; only `medium`s and below ⇒ pass with the
findings attached to the issue. Judges never say APPROVE/BLOCK; nothing reconciles
"verdicts"; nobody overrides a reviewer — there is nothing to override.

**AC verification.** Same pattern: the verify node emits per-AC judgments
(`met | unmet | unverifiable`, with evidence) as a payload; command-verifiable ACs are
written as ```` ```ac ````-fenced blocks in issue bodies (an activation lint requires
the convention), **snapshotted and hashed at activation** — what the operator approved
is what runs; post-activation edits cannot inject — and executed only when each command
matches the operator's user-level trust allowlist (06 §4), else reported
`unverifiable`, never executed. Extraction is literal (no prose parsing, E-8); the
routing decision over {gate exits × per-AC statuses} is policy.

**Votes.** Docket's existing proposal/vote machinery is kept and demoted to a gate type:
`gate: vote` creates a proposal, fan-outs the configured judge nodes to cast via CLI, and
the engine computes the outcome from threshold config (it already does: weighted score,
required voters). Used where today's fleet votes (TDD acceptance, security waivers,
destructive-change approval), per 05.

## 7. Budgets and cost governance

Budget and control inputs are core-owned (06 §11): per-step `expected_cost` in workflow
definitions, the per-run cap (`docket run start --budget`, `docket config` default),
attempt caps (step fields, config defaults), and concurrency + lease TTLs per executor
class (`[limits]`). The instance's `policy.toml` carries only wave-side spawn routing —
the engine never reads it.

Usage is recorded per step (executors attach what they observe; the run skill
back-fills from the wave journal, source recorded), but the cap does not rest on it:
the engine enforces against `max(reported, floor)` where the **floor** is computed from
facts the engine itself produced — each claimed step's `expected_cost` from the
workflow definition (06 §2), accrued per claim event — retries and loop entries
re-accrue, never released; bounded loops bound the floor. Reported usage can only
raise the counter, and missing usage rows are a dispatch discrepancy blocking the
next batch (§5). Crossing the run cap flips the run to
`waiting-human` with a budget-breach reason — a hard control resting on engine-owned
inputs, not voluntary reporting. Burn-rate is
visible at any time (`docket run report`). Per E-5, the governed quantities are the ones
that dominate spend: number of invocations (fan-out widths, attempt caps) and closure
sizes (recorded per brief, §8) — not contract byte counts.

Model routing is a policy table: executor hint → {model, effort}, with per-run overrides at
activation. The step records requested vs resolved model (the harness may substitute),
which makes tier drift measurable (and is exactly the census the fleet maintained by
hand). Security-sensitive node types carry a `never: [model…]` list honored at spawn
(the vendor-classifier constraint that pinned security work off Fable is a policy row
with a reason, not folklore).

## 8. Briefs (deterministic context assembly)

Context delivery is split at the genericity line: **`docket step claim` returns the
context bundle** — step row, activation-time issue snapshot, input artifact bodies,
pinned-file list with hashes — in the claim response itself (one atomic mediation: an
unclaimed executor has nothing, a claimed one has everything, closing E-6's
unread-pointer hole). **Formatting that bundle into the spawn prompt** is `docket step render` (or
`claim --render` in one atomic call): a shipped generic template, or the instance's
pinned template file — prompt *layout* is core mechanics, prompt *content* stays
instance data (06 §2). The assembled brief contains:

1. Framing header (run/issue/step ids, the issue body's AC section, scope);
2. The node contract (04) at its pinned version;
3. The knowledge fragments the contract's frontmatter declares, inlined;
4. Input artifacts (bodies, in pipeline-declared order), each delimited and labeled;
5. The output instruction (artifact kind to emit; payload schema name if any).

Properties: assembly is pure and **snapshot-pinned** — briefs read only hash-pinned
contract/fragment files, the activation-time issue-body snapshot, and recorded
artifacts (the diff artifact fingerprinted when its producing step completed), never
the live tree or a live issue body: same step ⇒ same brief, byte-identical, even
mid-run (06 §2). Closure size is recorded on the step (the honest cost figure, E-5);
nothing in it is optional for the node (E-6 — no pointers, no "read if needed").
Oversized context bundles (config caps, 06 §11.1) are an engine error at expansion time — the fix is a
pipeline/contract change, visible before spend, not a silent 107KB spawn.

## 9. Resume and crash-safety

All durable state is in Docket (T6, 06 §3 — workflow tables are additive and dormant
for non-workflow users); every mutation is CAS-guarded and event-logged. The consequences,
mechanically:

- **Executor dies** ⇒ heartbeats stop ⇒ lease lapses ⇒ step back to `ready`,
  attempt++. Its partial artifact was never recorded (recording is atomic at completion),
  so no torn state exists.
- **Conductor session dies** ⇒ nothing happens. Leases lapse; the run sits `active` with
  a ready set. Any new conductor session picks up exactly where things stood — a
  SessionStart hook injects `docket run status --active` so resumption is automatic
  (03 §7). There is no handoff narrative, no crash-recovery doctrine.
- **Docket contention** ⇒ SQLite WAL + busy timeout + single-transaction claims (06 §6);
  losers retry or receive CONFLICT — never a partial write.
- **Replay** ⇒ within the retention window (06 §3), the event log + immutable
  artifacts + pinned versions reconstruct a run's history exactly (what ran, with which brief, producing what, gated how, costing
  what). This is the audit story, the debugging story, and the telemetry story — one
  mechanism.

## 10. What this engine deliberately does not do

No server, no daemon: Docket stays a local-first single binary; `--follow` is a
polling subscription. No session
management: the engine never spawns executors — spawning is the harness's (03) — with
the sole exception of *gate commands*, shell subprocesses whose determinism is the
point, run only under the user-level trust model (06 §4). No *domain* vocabulary in Docket
core, ever — the genericity rule (01 §6, 06 §7). No expression language in pipelines (closed vocabulary, §4).
No model calls, ever. No cross-repo federation in v1 (08). Humans remain first-class:
`board`/`plan`/`show` render the work, `docket run status/report` render the runs, and
every human gate is answerable from the CLI — by design generic enough that a human
team could run a workflow with no agents at all (06 §9.1).
