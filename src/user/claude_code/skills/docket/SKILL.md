# Docket CLI Skill

Docket (`docket`) is a local-first, SQLite-backed issue tracker driven
entirely through a single CLI binary. There is no server and no network
call — all state lives in one SQLite `issues.db` file inside a **store**,
resolved via `internal/config` in this order:

1. **`DOCKET_PATH`** — taken as the store directory, normalized to absolute.
2. **A repo-local `.docket/` store** containing `issues.db`, discovered by
   walking from the cwd up to the git worktree toplevel (just the cwd
   outside a repository). The legacy per-repo layout keeps working wherever
   it already exists.
3. **The shared per-user store, `~/.docket`** — the default. Every
   repository resolving here is a **project** row in one database (see
   `docket project` below); issue ids are store-wide numbers.

This skill teaches an agent how to drive `docket` end to end: issue CRUD
and lifecycle, file attachments, comments, labels, relations, dependency
graphs, execution planning, consensus voting, docs, watch mode, and
export/import.

Every command supports **two output modes**: human-readable (default,
colorized via lipgloss when the terminal supports it) and machine-readable
JSON (`--json`). **Agents should always pass `--json`** for reliable
parsing — the examples below show both.

## Quick Start

```bash
docket init                                   # initialize the resolved store (~/.docket by default)
docket init --local                           # opt out: create a repo-local .docket store in the cwd
docket issue create -t "Fix login bug" --json # create an issue, get its ID back
docket issue list --json                      # list open issues
docket issue show DKT-1 --json                # show full detail incl. comments/activity
docket next --json                            # what's ready to work on right now?
```

Issue IDs are formatted `DKT-<n>` (e.g. `DKT-42`), document IDs `DOC-<n>`,
and proposal (vote) IDs `DKT-V<n>` — all three accept either the bare number
or the formatted string as CLI arguments (`model.ParseID`, `ParseDocID`,
`ParseProposalID` all strip the prefix case-insensitively). The issue prefix
is a **per-project display setting** (`docket project set-prefix`): another
project's issues may render `VOR-42`, but the number is the store-wide
identity and `DKT-` always parses whatever the prefix.

## Global Flags & Output Contract

Defined once on `rootCmd` in `internal/cli/root.go` and inherited by every
subcommand:

| Flag | Shorthand | Type | Default | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--json` | — | string | `""` | Switch to machine-readable JSON envelope on stdout. Bare `--json` selects v1; `--json=v2` selects the uniform envelope. See below. |
| `--quiet` | `-q` | bool | `false` | Suppress non-essential human-mode info/warning lines on stderr. No effect in `--json` mode (already silent). |
| `--watch` | `-w` | bool | `false` | Re-run the command on an interval and refresh output. Accepted only on the exact allowlist below; every other command — read-only or not — rejects it with a `VALIDATION_ERROR`. |
| `--interval` | — | duration | `2s` | Poll interval for `--watch` **and** `events list --follow`. Minimum `500ms`; anything lower is a `VALIDATION_ERROR`. |

### `--watch` eligibility

`--watch`/`-w` and `--interval` are hidden from the `--help` of every command
NOT in this allowlist (hidden at help-render time — the flags are shared
persistent globals, so they exist on every command even when help omits
them), defined in `internal/cli/watch_commands.go`:

```
docket board
docket issue list
docket issue show
docket issue log
docket issue graph
docket issue comment list
docket doc list
docket doc show
docket doc comment list
docket next
docket plan
docket stats
docket config
docket vote list
docket vote show
docket vote result
docket events list
docket step list
```

`docket events list` is on the list because its `--follow` polls on the same
`--interval`; the rest is the tracker surface.

Attempting `--watch` on any command off the list — read-only (`docket
project list`) or write alike — fails with a `VALIDATION_ERROR` whose
message enumerates the live allowlist: `--watch is limited to: docket board,
docket config, ...` (generated from the allowlist by
`watchRejectionMessage()`). The message's own enumeration is authoritative
if this copy ever drifts.

### JSON envelope shape

All JSON output (`internal/output/json.go`) is a single-line JSON object
written to stdout via `json.Encoder` (HTML-escaping disabled).

Success:
```json
{"ok": true, "data": { ... }, "message": "Created DKT-1: Fix login bug"}
```
`message` is `omitempty` — it is present on success responses but callers
should not depend on it being non-empty for every command.

Error:
```json
{"ok": false, "error": "issue DKT-99 not found", "code": "NOT_FOUND"}
```

### `--json` values (v1 vs v2)

`--json` is a string flag with `NoOptDefVal = "v1"`, so a bare `--json` behaves
exactly as it did when the flag was a boolean.

| Value | Mode | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| (flag absent) | human | |
| `--json` (bare) | JSON v1 | byte-identical to the pre-v2 output |
| `--json=v1` | JSON v1 | explicit form |
| `--json=true`, `--json=1` | JSON v1 | retained from the boolean-flag era |
| `--json=v2` | JSON v2 | uniform envelope, see below |
| `--json=false`, `--json=0` | human | retained from the boolean-flag era |
| anything else | `VALIDATION_ERROR` (exit 3) | e.g. `--json=v3` |

**v1 is frozen, with one recorded amendment.** New response data appears under
v2 only, which is what makes `--json` safe for existing scripts.

The amendment is DKT-55: an issue's `scope` reaches the **v1** payload of
`issue show` and `issue list` **when the issue declares one, and only then**.
An issue with no declared scope emits no `scope` key and stays byte-identical
to the pre-scope shape, so a repo that never passed `--scope` sees a v1 that
has not moved; a declared-but-empty scope emits `[]`. The amendment was made
because the declaration is the fact an operator checks first, and it was
invisible on the surface everyone reads. Nothing else amends v1.

Under **`--json=v2`**, list commands return a uniform envelope instead of their
per-command key (`issues`, `docs`, `proposals`, `entries`):

```json
{"ok": true, "data": {"items": [...], "total": 42, "truncated": true}}
```

- `total` is the number of matching records **before** `--limit` is applied.
- `truncated` is `true` when `--limit` dropped records.

This closes a silent-drop bug: under v1, `docket next --limit 10` and
`docket issue log --limit 10` report `"total": 10` whether 10 or 10 000 records
matched. Under v2 both report the true total and set `truncated`.

Commands returning a single entity (`issue show`, `issue create`, …) are not
wrapped — v2 returns the same object as v1, plus a `version` field (see
Optimistic concurrency below).

Under v2, a **negative** `--limit` is a `VALIDATION_ERROR` on every list verb.
Under v1 the legacy behaviors are preserved unchanged (`issue list` and `next`
treat it as unlimited; `issue log` clamps it to 1).

### Error codes & exit codes

Defined in `internal/output/json.go`. The process exit code always matches
the table below, in both JSON and human mode (`ExitCodeForError`):

| `code` | Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `GENERAL_ERROR` | 1 | Unclassified failure (DB error, I/O error, etc.) |
| `NOT_FOUND` | 2 | Referenced issue/doc/proposal/label/relation does not exist |
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 3 | Bad input: invalid enum value, missing required flag, mutually exclusive flags, non-interactive environment without required flags, invalid `--json` value, negative `--limit` under v2, `--if-version < 1` |
| `CONFLICT` | 4 | State conflict: duplicate relation, cycle detected, already-voted, non-empty DB on import without `--merge`/`--replace`, `--if-version` mismatch, a dispatch already open for the run, `next --run` while a dispatch is open or discrepancies exist, `dispatch verify` byte mismatch, `dispatch close` over an unreconciled discrepancy, `dispatch backfill-usage` repeating a `(step, attempt, unit)` already recorded, any dispatch verb finding no manifest open, `step annotate` on a step that has not finished, or `issue move --project` on an issue a run holds |
| `AUTH_ERROR` | 5 | The supplied capability token does not hold this lease (or the entity is unclaimed) |
| `STALE_LEASE` | 6 | The token is correct but the lease has expired — claim again |
| `TIMEOUT` | 7 | Reserved — no verb emits this yet |
| `UNTRUSTED` | 8 | Reserved — no verb emits this yet |
| `GONE` | 9 | `events list --since` names a cursor below the retained minimum: those events no longer exist |

Codes 1–4 and their exit numbers are a frozen contract and are never
renumbered. Codes 5–8 are declared ahead of the verbs that will raise them, so
the taxonomy is fixed once rather than extended per feature. `GONE` **appends**
at 9 rather than taking exit 6 — that number is `STALE_LEASE`, which emits today,
and two codes sharing one exit would be indistinguishable to a script testing
`$?`. New codes only ever append.

**`GONE` is reached by `docket events prune`, and by nothing else.** The engine
never deletes an event on its own — there is no retention sweep, no compaction at
`run done`, and no prune inside `next` — so a repo whose operator has never run
that verb retains the first event ever written and can never answer `GONE` to
anybody. Once something *has* been pruned, a cursor naming events below what
survives gets this code and a message naming the `seq` to resume from.

Exit code `0` is success. Note `PersistentPreRunE` also returns `NOT_FOUND`
(exit 2) if the resolved store has no database yet — run `docket init` first.

### Optimistic concurrency (`--if-version`)

Every mutable entity carries a `version` counter that increments on each
mutation. Pass `--if-version N` to a mutating verb to apply the change only if
the entity is still at version `N`:

```bash
V=$(docket issue show DKT-1 --json=v2 | jq -r '.data.version')
docket issue edit DKT-1 --json=v2 --if-version "$V" -s in-progress
```

- Version matches → the write applies and the version increments.
- Version differs → `CONFLICT` (exit 4) and **nothing is written**.
- Entity is missing → `NOT_FOUND` (exit 2), not `CONFLICT`.
- `--if-version` below 1 → `VALIDATION_ERROR` (exit 3); versions start at 1.

Omitting `--if-version` preserves the previous last-writer-wins behavior. The
version still increments, so a concurrent CAS writer detects the change.

Read the current version from `.data.version` under `--json=v2`; v1 payloads do
not carry the field.

Verbs accepting `--if-version`: `issue edit`, `issue move`, `issue close`,
`issue reopen`.

### Idempotency keys (`--idempotency-key`)

Create verbs accept `--idempotency-key KEY`. Repeating a create with the same
key returns the **original** entity with exit 0 and creates nothing new — so a
retry after a dropped connection cannot duplicate work:

```bash
docket issue create --json -t "Deploy checklist" --idempotency-key deploy-2026-08-02
docket issue create --json -t "Deploy checklist" --idempotency-key deploy-2026-08-02
# → same DKT-N both times, one issue created
```

Keys are scoped per verb, so the same key on `issue create` and `doc create` is
two independent records. An empty `--idempotency-key ""` is a
`VALIDATION_ERROR`. Without the flag, creates are never deduplicated.

Verbs accepting `--idempotency-key`: `issue create`, `doc create`,
`vote create`, `issue comment add`, `doc comment add`.

### Claims, leases, and capability tokens

`docket issue claim` takes a lease on an issue and mints a **capability
token**. The claim is atomic: exactly one of any number of concurrent claimants
wins, and the losers get `CONFLICT` (exit 4).

```bash
TOKEN=$(docket issue claim DKT-1 --owner ci-runner-7 --json | jq -r '.data.token')
DOCKET_TOKEN="$TOKEN" docket issue heartbeat DKT-1     # extend while working
DOCKET_TOKEN="$TOKEN" docket issue release DKT-1       # or close, when done
```

**The token is returned exactly once.** Only its hash is stored, so it cannot
be read back from the database — capture it from the claim response or claim
again. It never appears in `issue show`, `issue list`, or `issue log`.

**Tokens pass via `DOCKET_TOKEN` or stdin, never argv.** There is no `--token`
flag on any verb: `ps` exposes argv to every user on a shared host. Pipe it
(`echo "$TOKEN" | docket issue heartbeat DKT-1`) or export it.

Refusals:

| Situation | Code | Exit |
|---|---|---|
| No token supplied to a token-requiring verb | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 3 |
| Token does not hold the lease, or issue unclaimed | `AUTH_ERROR` | 5 |
| Token is correct but the lease expired | `STALE_LEASE` | 6 |
| Claiming an issue whose lease is live | `CONFLICT` | 4 |

`AUTH_ERROR` covers both "wrong token" and "unclaimed" deliberately — a caller
holding no capability learns nothing about whether a lease exists.
`STALE_LEASE` is distinct because it means *re-claim*: the token was right,
time ran out.

**Expiry is the liveness mechanism.** A lease that lapses without release
returns the issue to the unclaimed pool: the next claim simply wins, and
`attempt` records that a claim was made. No reaper runs — expiry is resolved by
the next claim — and **no read verb ever writes**. Reads report *effective*
status, so an expired lease shows `"live": false` the instant it lapses:

```bash
docket issue show DKT-1 --json=v2 | jq '.data.lease'
# {"owner":"ci-runner-7","expires_ms":1754161200000,"attempt":1,"live":false}
```

`attempt` counts claims for all time — never decremented, never reset — so a
killed worker's claim and its successor's both appear.

The `lease` object is **`--json=v2` only**, and absent entirely when the issue
is unclaimed. An issue that is never claimed behaves exactly as it did before
leases existed on every verb.

`docket issue close` ends a live lease as a side effect. The holder may always
close; a non-holder closing a live-leased issue is refused `AUTH_ERROR`, so a
bystander cannot silently evict a working holder. Closing an **unclaimed**
issue needs no token.

See `docs/spec/security.md` for the full token model, including what a lease
does and does not defend against.

### Engine configuration (`docket config set|get`)

Engine defaults live in the database and are read by the claim machinery:

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lease.ttl.default` | duration | `15m` | fallback lease TTL |
| `lease.ttl.<class>` | duration | (falls back to default) | per-class lease TTL |
| `attempt.max` | int ≥ 1 | `3` | maximum claims per entity |
| `budget.default` | number ≥ 0 | `0` | default per-run budget cap; 0 is unlimited. Resolved at `run start` and stored on the run, so setting it later does not re-cap a run already started |
| `budget.unit` | unit name or `""` | `""` | which recorded usage unit the run cap counts. Empty (the default) means the cap rests on the declared-cost floor alone |
| `dispatch.ttl` | duration | `30m` | how long a dispatch manifest stays open before `next` auto-abandons it |
| `dispatch.grace` | duration | `15m` | how long a claimed step may go unrecorded before it counts as a dispatch discrepancy |
| `events.retain` | duration or `0` | `0` | how long events are protected from `events prune`. `0` (the default) retains **everything**, so prune deletes nothing until a policy is set |
| `context.warn_bytes` | int ≥ 0 | `65536` | context size that triggers a warning |
| `context.error_bytes` | int ≥ 0 | `131072` | context size that triggers an error |
| `vote.rule.<name>.threshold` | float in (0,1] | (unset) | approval threshold a `vote_rule` tallies at |
| `vote.rule.<name>.criticality` | low\|medium\|high\|critical | `medium` | the proposal's criticality |
| `vote.hold.rule` | rule name or `""` | `""` | vote rule a **materialized held step** is tallied under. Empty (the default) mints held steps as `human` for one operator to decide |
| `vote.hold.voters` | comma-separated names or `""` | `""` | who casts on a materialized held step. Empty (the default) mints held steps as `human` |

```bash
docket config set lease.ttl.write 45m
docket config get lease.ttl.write --json     # {"key":...,"value":"45m","source":"set"}
docket config get                            # every key, with its source
```

`source` is `set` or `default`, so "nobody configured this" is distinguishable
from "configured to the same value". An unknown key or a value of the wrong
type is a `VALIDATION_ERROR` (exit 3) at `set` time — a typo never silently
stores a key nothing reads. The class in `lease.ttl.<class>` is an opaque
string; docket never interprets it.

Under the shared store, config is **layered per project**: a read resolves the
current project's override, then the store-wide value, then the built-in
default (the first two both report `source: set`). `config set --global`
writes the store-wide default instead of this project's override, and
`config get --global` reads the store-wide values ignoring this project's
overrides.

**Vote rules.** A workflow's `type="vote"` step names a rule rather than passing
flags, because a step cannot pass flags. A rule *exists* iff its `.threshold` is
set — criticality has a default, so it cannot be the existence test:

```bash
docket config set vote.rule.majority.threshold 0.6
docket config set vote.rule.majority.criticality high
```

`<name>` is opaque, exactly as the lease class is. A step whose `vote_rule`
names an unregistered rule is refused at `workflow register` (V26), naming the
rule and listing the registered ones — a workflow that cannot possibly tally
should not register. Note that `required_voters` comes from the step's own
`voters` list, not from the rule: a rule is about *how strictly to tally*, the
step about *who casts*.

**Held steps by tally.** A materialized `<step>-held` step is the one row in a
run no author wrote, so it has no `[[step]]` table to carry `voters` and
`vote_rule`. `vote.hold.rule` and `vote.hold.voters` are where an instance says
them instead:

```bash
docket config set vote.rule.panel.threshold 0.6
docket config set vote.hold.rule panel
docket config set vote.hold.voters alice,bob,carol
```

**BOTH keys are required, and unset is a strict no-op:** with either missing,
holds are minted `human` exactly as they always were, and one operator approves
or rejects them. With both set they are minted `vote` and flow through the
ordinary vote lifecycle. The escalation is one-directional:

- **pass** — the computed value stands, identical to `step approve` on the
  cluster. The payload records `operator_resolved` and the aggregate resumes.
- **anything else** — the step **parks** at `waiting-human` and the question
  passes to an operator, who answers it with `step approve` (including
  `--value`) or `step reject`. A tally may confirm the engine's own computation
  and may never overrule it, so a panel that could not agree cannot produce the
  effect of an operator who declined.

The MINTED KIND is what persists: config supplies the roster, the step row
supplies the question's type. Editing or clearing these keys mid-run changes who
casts on holds minted *after* the edit, never what an already-open question is.

### Interactive forms

Several write commands (`issue create`, `issue delete` with sub-issues,
`vote create`, `vote cast`, `doc create`, `doc delete`, `label delete`)
fall back to an interactive `huh` form when required
flags are omitted and stdin is a TTY. `import --replace` is the one
exception: it requires `--yes` unconditionally, in every output mode and
regardless of terminal attachment — never a prompt, and never `--json` as
consent (DKT-15). (`issue comment` and `doc comment`
use a different fallback — they open `$EDITOR` when no message is piped
and stdin is a TTY; see the Comments section below.) **In non-interactive/agent contexts
(no TTY) these commands return a `VALIDATION_ERROR` listing the missing
flags instead of hanging** — always pass all required flags explicitly
when scripting or running as an agent. `--json` mode never launches an
interactive form; missing required fields are always a hard
`VALIDATION_ERROR` in JSON mode.

---

## Workflow: Issue Creation & Editing

Create an issue (only `--title` is required in JSON mode):

```bash
docket issue create --json \
  -t "Add rate limiting to API" \
  -d "Prevent abuse on public endpoints" \
  -s todo -p high -T feature \
  -l backend -l must-have \
  -f internal/api/router.go \
  -a "@alice"
```

Description can be piped from stdin with `-d -`:

```bash
echo "Long description..." | docket issue create --json -t "Title" -d -
```

Edit only the fields you pass — `issue edit` uses `cmd.Flags().Changed(...)`
so omitted flags are left untouched, not reset to zero values:

```bash
docket issue edit DKT-1 --json -s in-progress -a "@bob"
docket issue edit DKT-1 --json --parent DKT-5      # reparent
docket issue edit DKT-1 --json --parent none        # make it a root issue again
docket issue edit DKT-1 --json -f a.go -f b.go       # REPLACES the file list (not additive)
```

Reparenting validates against cycles (`db.IsDescendant`) and rejects
self-parenting with `VALIDATION_ERROR`/`CONFLICT`.

Status transitions and other lifecycle commands:

```bash
docket issue move DKT-1 review --json     # arbitrary status transition
docket issue move DKT-1 --project vorpal --json  # migrate issue + subtree to another project
docket issue close DKT-1 --json           # shorthand for: move <id> done
docket issue reopen DKT-1 --json          # shorthand for: move <id> backlog (only if currently done)
docket issue delete DKT-1 --json --force  # cascade-delete issue + all sub-issues
docket issue delete DKT-1 --json --orphan # delete issue, promote sub-issues to root
```

Valid `--status` values: `backlog`, `todo`, `in-progress`, `review`, `done`.
Valid `--priority` values: `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`.
Valid `--type`/`-T` values: `task`, `bug`, `feature`, `epic`, `chore`.

List and inspect:

```bash
docket issue list --json -s todo -s in-progress -p high --tree
docket issue show DKT-1 --json     # full detail: sub-issues, relations, comments, activity, docs
docket issue log DKT-1 --json --limit 50
```

---

## Workflow: File Attachment (`docket issue file`)

```bash
docket issue file add DKT-1 --json internal/api/router.go internal/api/middleware.go
docket issue file list DKT-1 --json
docket issue file remove DKT-1 --json internal/api/router.go
```

`add`/`remove` take 2+ positional args (`id` then one or more file paths) —
there is no `-f` flag on `issue file add`; that's only on `issue create -f`
and `issue edit -f`. Files are additive on `file add` (unlike `issue edit
-f`, which replaces the whole list).

---

## Workflow: Comments

```bash
docket issue comment add DKT-1 --json -m "Investigated — root cause is a stale cache key"
docket issue comment list DKT-1 --json
```

`-m`/`--message` is optional: if omitted and stdin is a pipe, the body is
read from stdin; if omitted and stdin is a TTY (human mode only), `$EDITOR`
(default `vi`) is opened. In `--json` mode, `-m` (or piped stdin) is
required — there is no editor fallback.

---

## Workflow: Labels & Relations

```bash
docket issue label add DKT-1 --json backend must-have --color "#ff0000"
docket issue label rm DKT-1 --json must-have
docket issue label list --json
docket issue label delete backend --json --force   # --force skips the attached-issue-count confirmation

docket issue link add DKT-1 --json blocks DKT-2      # DKT-1 blocks DKT-2
docket issue link add DKT-1 --json depends_on DKT-3   # DKT-1 depends_on DKT-3
docket issue link remove DKT-1 --json blocks DKT-2
docket issue link list DKT-1 --json
```

Valid `<relation>` values (`model.RelationType`): `blocks`, `depends_on`,
`relates_to`, `duplicates`.

---

## Workflow: Dependency Graph (`docket issue graph`)

```bash
docket issue graph DKT-1 --json --direction both --depth 2
docket issue graph DKT-1 --mermaid --direction down   # Mermaid flowchart, human-readable only
```

`--direction` must be one of `up` (what blocks this), `down` (what this
blocks), or `both` (default). `--depth 0` (default) means unlimited BFS
traversal. Use this before touching a shared interface to assess blast
radius.

---

## Workflow: Planning (`docket plan` and `docket next`)

`docket plan` groups all non-done issues into dependency-ordered execution
phases (topological sort; a cycle returns `CONFLICT`):

```bash
docket plan --json
docket plan --json --root DKT-1                      # scope to a parent issue's subtree
docket plan --json -s backlog -s todo -l must-have    # filter by status/label
docket plan --json -p high -p critical -T bug -a alice # filter by priority/type/assignee
```

`docket next` finds work-ready issues — no incomplete blockers, in one of
the ready statuses (default `backlog`,`todo`):

```bash
docket next --json
docket next --json -s todo -p high -p critical -l must-have --limit 5
```

---

## Workflow: Workflow definitions (`docket workflow`)

A **workflow** is a declarative description of the steps a piece of work goes
through: what runs, in what order, what each step needs from the ones before
it, and what happens when something fails. It is a TOML file you register into
the database; nothing about it is specific to any kind of work or any kind of
worker.

Start from a shipped template and register what it writes:

```bash
docket workflow init --template standard-dev
# → wrote .docket/config/workflows/standard-dev.toml
docket workflow lint .docket/config/workflows/standard-dev.toml --json
docket workflow register .docket/config/workflows/standard-dev.toml --json
docket workflow list --json
docket workflow show standard-dev --json
```

At this stage registration is all that happens: a registered workflow is
stored, inspectable, and validated, but nothing runs it yet. A repo that never
registers one behaves exactly as it did before workflows existed.

### Shipped templates

| Template | Shape |
|---|---|
| `standard-dev` | two steps — run the checks, then have a person approve. One fenced-command gate, no fanout. |
| `parallel-check` | prepare → several checks in parallel → summarize → verify. Fanout with a join quorum. |

Both are ordinary definitions, byte-identical to files you could have typed,
and both are asserted to register cleanly by a test.

### Registration is content-addressed and immutable

A registered `name@version` is **frozen**:

| Second registration of… | Result |
|---|---|
| the same bytes | success, returns the existing row, changes nothing |
| **different** bytes at the same `name@version` | `CONFLICT` (exit 4), naming both hashes |
| any bytes at a new `version` | an ordinary registration |

To change a workflow, bump `[pipeline].version`. This exists so that pinning
means something: a run that pinned `name@version` cannot have the definition
swapped underneath it.

`register` accepts `-` to read stdin, so configuration generated in a pipeline
needs no temp file:

```bash
generate-workflow | docket workflow register - --json
```

### Checking a draft without registering it (`docket workflow lint`)

Registration is a persistent write: it inserts a row and freezes a
`name@version`. Checking a draft that way either accumulates versions nobody
wanted or does not happen at all — so `lint` runs the identical validation and
**writes nothing**:

```bash
docket workflow lint .docket/config/workflows/standard-dev.toml --json
# → {"name":"standard-dev","version":1,"sha256":"…","registration":"new"}
generate-workflow | docket workflow lint - --json     # `-` reads stdin
```

It is the **same pipeline `register` runs**, call for call: grammar and step
rules, vote rules against the config registry (V26), and threshold fields and
literals against the registered schemas. The two cannot report different
verdicts on the same bytes.

The registry is **consulted, never written**, and the verdict says what a real
register would do:

| `registration` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `new` | nothing holds this `name@version`; a register would insert |
| `unchanged` | the same bytes are already registered; a register would be an idempotent success |
| *(refusal)* | **different** bytes hold this `name@version` — `CONFLICT` (exit 4), naming both hashes and the version to bump `[pipeline].version` to |

**The conflict case fails the lint rather than reporting a third outcome.** A
definition that cannot register as it stands has not passed a check — and that
case is the trap this verb exists for: an edited file at a frozen `name@version`
validates cleanly and then refuses the *whole activation* the next time a run
starts.

### Retiring a version from binding (`docket workflow deprecate`)

A registered **name** binds forever at its highest version, and deleting its
TOML does not unregister it — nothing removes a `workflows` row. `deprecate`
retires one version from binding without deleting it:

```bash
docket workflow deprecate standard-dev@1 --json
docket workflow deprecate standard-dev@1 --json --restore   # back into binding
```

The row survives and stays fully readable: `workflow show` renders it,
`--source` emits the exact registered bytes, and a run that already **pinned**
it still resolves it and still completes. Only its candidacy for NEW bindings
stops — matching picks the highest **non-retired** version of each name, so
retiring the top version falls back to the one beneath it, and retiring every
version of a name takes that name out of routing entirely.

A retired version reports `deprecated_at_ms` under `--json=v2` (see
`workflow list` below) and prints `[deprecated]` in human mode.

### The definition grammar

A definition has `[pipeline]`, an optional `[match]`, an optional `[limits]`,
and one or more `[[step]]` tables. **Unknown keys are an error**, naming the
key and its step — a typo'd `max_attempt` silently taking a default is exactly
the bug that makes a workflow behave differently from what its author read.

```toml
[pipeline]
name    = "standard-dev"       # required; runs pin name@version
version = 1                    # required, integer >= 1
description = "…"              # optional

[match]                        # which issues bind to this workflow
                               # evaluated over the HIGHEST version of each name
kind          = ["task", "bug"]
labels_any    = ["…"]
labels_all    = ["…"]
unless_labels = ["…"]          # evaluated last and wins

[limits]                       # per executor CLASS, not per step
write = { max = 1, lease_ttl = "45m", max_step_duration = "2h" }
read  = 4                      # bare int is shorthand for { max = 4 }

[[step]]
name  = "check"
after = []                     # [] means root; see below
executor = "author"
emits = "check-report"
```

**`[limits]` keys, and what each bounds.** A class is an opaque string; these
are the only three things a bound on one does.

| Key | Bounds |
|---|---|
| `max` | how many steps of the class may be `claimed`/`running` at once. A **finite** `max` is also what makes the class write-class for the reap acknowledgment below — a class with no `max` gets neither ack rows nor a headroom hold |
| `lease_ttl` | the lease a claim of this class takes, overriding `docket config lease.ttl.<class>` |
| `max_step_duration` | a **schedule-to-close** bound measured from the claim, **independent of heartbeats** |

`max_step_duration` is the one worth stating plainly: a step past it is reaped
**even with a live lease and a fresh heartbeat**, which is the whole difference
between it and a lease TTL. A runaway holder cannot renew forever. It is a
`[limits]` key on the workflow class — there is no `docket config` key for it.

**Both reaps are scoped to an ACTIVE run.** A lease that lapses while a run sits
in `waiting-human` is not reaped, and neither is a step past its
`max_step_duration` there. A TTL is a bet that a silent worker is dead and its
step is better re-offered; on a run that is not active nothing would be offered
anyway, so the reap is pure loss — it clears a live worker's lease and takes a
write-reap hold on its class. This is a **suspension, not an exemption**: no
expiry is rewritten, so the first `next` after the run returns to `active` reaps
what came due meanwhile. It matters because the state is ordinary rather than
exotic — a run parks when *any* step is parked, leaving that step's siblings
legitimately `claimed` at `waiting-human`.

`[[step]]` fields, in full:

| Field | Type / default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string, required, unique in workflow | step identity |
| `executor` | string (opaque hint) | a worker step; docket never interprets the value |
| `action` | string | a deterministic computation step |
| `type` | `"human"` \| `"vote"` | an operator gate |
| `fanout` | [hints] | expands to one parallel sibling per entry |
| — | | **exactly one** of `executor` / `action` / `type` / `fanout` per step |
| `class` | string, default = the `executor` value | the key `[limits]` accounts against |
| `emits` | artifact-kind string | **required on executor steps**; what the step records |
| `payload` | `name@version` | a registered payload schema; the step's `--payload-file` is validated against it at `complete`, from the bytes the run pinned |
| `voters`, `vote_rule` | [hints], name | **required on `type="vote"`**, forbidden elsewhere |
| `after` | [step names], **required** except on the first step and `loop = true` steps | predecessors; `[]` means root |
| `inputs` | [`"<step>.<kind>"` \| `"<step>.*"` \| `"<step>.gate-results"` \| `"issue.body"` \| `"issue.diff"`] | artifacts delivered to the step |
| `holds_tree` | bool, **default true** | whether this step OCCUPIES its issue's scope while it runs. It is what scope exclusion consults, and what decides whether the step's completion records an `issue.diff` |
| `gates` | [name \| `{name, source="fence:<tag>", pre=bool}`] | checks; `pre = true` runs at claim |
| `params` | opaque table | arguments to an `action` step |
| `min_siblings` | int, default = all | how many fanout siblings the join needs |
| `threshold` | table: routing → predicate | routing computed from the step's results |
| `on_fail` | `"fix-loop"` \| `"waiting-human"` \| `"skip"` \| `"abandon-issue"`; default `"waiting-human"` | where a failure routes. **Required explicitly on `type="human"` and `type="vote"` steps** — the default is a routing nobody chose |
| `loop` | bool, default false | marks a loop-body step |
| `after_loop` | step name | where execution re-enters after a loop body |
| `max_attempts` | int ≥ 1 | per-instance retry budget |
| `max_fix_loops` | int ≥ 0 | loop-entry budget per issue |
| `expected_cost` | number ≥ 0, default 0 | the step's contribution to the run's budget floor, accrued **per claim**. Per expanded sibling on a fanout — four siblings accrue four times, no proration |
| `when` | predicate over `kind` / `labels` | step is skipped when false |
| `metadata` | opaque table | recorded and delivered verbatim |
| `packet` | list of paths, relative to `.docket/config/` | files inlined into the step's rendered work packet, **in declared order**. Each must be pinned by the run (they are, automatically, if they live under `.docket/config/`); an entry the run did not pin is refused **at activation**. An entry may carry the `{executor}` token, substituted with that sibling's executor hint — which is how one `fanout` step gives each sibling a different file. Docket reads their bytes and never interprets them |

**`packet` inlines files; it never points at them.** The rendered packet carries
each file's **body**, delimited and labeled with its path and hash, so a worker
receives one document rather than a list of things to go read. Bytes are
admitted only when they hash to what the run pinned: a file edited after
activation is `CONFLICT` (exit 4) naming **both** hashes, and one deleted is
`NOT_FOUND` (exit 2). That is what makes a packet reproducible — same step, same
packet, byte-identical, even mid-run.

A packet file may declare more files in a `packet_includes:` frontmatter list,
and those are inlined immediately after it. **That is the only frontmatter key
Docket reads** — every other key is ignored entirely, not validated and not
surfaced — and includes are followed **exactly one level deep**. A malformed
`packet_includes` is `VALIDATION_ERROR` at render, naming the file; a declared
include that is missing or unpinned is refused rather than silently omitted.

#### Engine-produced inputs

Three `inputs` forms resolve to something the engine recorded rather than to a
step's declared artifact.

`issue.body` is the activation snapshot. `issue.diff` is the run's computed VCS
diff, and **it is recorded only at the completion of a step that holds the
tree** — `holds_tree`, default true, the same declaration scope exclusion reads.
A non-holding step records nothing, and its consumers resolve to the artifact
the last **holding** step recorded: the reviewed object, pinned at the moment
the change existed, byte-identical for every sibling that reads it. Recomputing
at every executor completion was the defect this closes — read-shaped fanout
siblings each re-diffed the *live* tree at their own record time, so a diff
taken after the change landed came out empty and one taken beside a sibling's
in-flight probe carried the probe. Action, human, and vote steps never record a
diff either; with no diff artifact at all, the input resolves to an **empty
diff**, never an error and never a live `git diff`.

**The bundle carries a machine-readable target ref (DKT-24).** Context
assembly lifts the resolved `issue.diff` artifact's round record onto the
bundle as `target_sha` — the commit the diff's tree stood at — and
`target_worktree` — the producing record's declared worktree path, good while
that checkout is still on disk (it is swept at integration). Both are omitted
entirely when the resolved diff carries no round record. The default packet
template states them in its header, so a reviewing consumer no longer
re-derives the tree from a prose convention in the change-summary's first
line. They are exactly as reproducible as the input they describe.

`<step>.gate-results` is the named step's **recorded** gate results, served from
the ledger rather than re-run — one input per `done` producer instance, carrying
a JSON array in §11.4's gate-result shape (`gate`, `ordinal`, `argv`, `exit`,
`duration_ms`, `output`, `truncated`, `verdict`, `pre`, `reason`), the same
shape a claim response's `pre_gates` carries. Instance selection mirrors
ordinary artifact resolution — same issue, `done` only, ordinal-scoped with
the per-input fallback, siblings in index order — with one departure (DKT-12):
the **requesting step admits itself regardless of status**, so a self-declared
`<self>.gate-results` reads the step's own claim-time `pre = true` rows (which
commit before context assembly, while the step is still `claimed`).
Completion-side rows, not yet recorded at claim, show up as the empty array.

```toml
inputs = ["implement.change-summary", "implement.gate-results"]
```

The producer **must be a step of this workflow**, but need not declare gates:
a producer that recorded none resolves to an **empty array**, not an absent
input, because "this step ran no checks" is an answer a consumer can act on
while a missing input reads as a resolution failure. (Gates can also arrive
from a `fence:` source the definition does not enumerate, so requiring a
declaration would refuse correct workflows.) `gate-results` is a **reserved
kind**: a step emitting it is refused at `workflow register` (V11a), since an
artifact of that kind could never be addressed — the engine-served form would
shadow it.

**`after` is required, and `after = []` is how you declare a root.** Implicit
topology was a footgun: a step that forgets `after` would silently become a
root and run first. Only the first step and `loop = true` steps may omit it.

**Every gate step must declare `on_fail` explicitly — `type="human"` and
`type="vote"` alike (V13a).** The default is `waiting-human`, so a gate that
declares nothing has a routing its author never chose.

**A `type="human"` step additionally may not route rejects to `waiting-human`**
(V13): it would park the issue on the resolution of the very thing that just
rejected it, a deadlock. Legal values there are `fix-loop`, `skip`, and
`abandon-issue`.

**A `type="vote"` step MAY route to `waiting-human`**, and often should: on a
vote gate that routing is the ESCALATION — a tally that did not reach its
threshold decided nothing, so the question passes to an operator who has not
been asked yet, which is not a wait on the decider that just declined. All four
values are legal there. Because both readings are defensible, the grammar makes
you say which you mean rather than inheriting one silently.

`threshold` predicates have the shape `agg(field op literal)` with
`agg ∈ {any, all, count>=n}` and `op ∈ {==, !=, >=, >, <=, <}`; routings are
`fix-loop`, `waiting-human`, `pass`, or a step name (which interposes that step
as a gate). Routings are evaluated **top to bottom, first match routes**, and
no match routes `pass`.

**Fields and literals are still opaque tokens to docket — but they are checked
against your schema.** When a step declares a `payload`, `workflow register`
verifies that every predicate's field is one the schema declares, that every
literal is a value that field accepts, and that any ordered operator
(`>=`, `>`, `<=`, `<`) names a field the schema marks `ordered_enum`. Docket
learns that `high` comes after `medium` because your document said so; it holds
no opinion about what either word means.

A step with a `threshold` and **no** `payload` is legal and unchanged:
equality has never needed an order. An ordered comparison over such a field
**parks the step** `waiting-human` with a reason naming the predicate — docket
declines rather than guessing an order.

**Executor hints are opaque.** `executor`, `fanout` entries, `voters`, and
`class` are strings docket stores, echoes back, and uses as map keys. There is
no registry of known executors and no behavior keyed on the value: put role
names, team names, or people's names there and they mean what you intend.
`params` and `metadata` are likewise opaque — docket never reads a key inside
them.

### Gates — what actually runs

A gate is a check a step must pass. It comes in two spellings:

```toml
gates = ["tests"]                                       # a named gate
gates = [{ name = "checks", source = "fence:checks" }]  # commands from the issue body
gates = [{ name = "measure", pre = true }]              # runs at claim, not at complete
```

**A gate name is an opaque string.** Docket looks it up in your trust store and
never interprets it — there is no registry of known gates, no gate whose name
has behavior, and no default gate.

**Every gate needs a matching trust entry or it does not run** (see
`docket trust` below and security.md §7). An unmatched gate is recorded
`verdict: "unmatched"` with null `argv` and null `exit`, nothing spawns, and
**the step fails** and routes per `on_fail`. A workflow whose check cannot run
has not passed its check.

| Spelling | Where the command comes from |
|---|---|
| `"name"` or `{name}` | the trust entry's own argv — the entry *is* the command |
| `{name, source="fence:<tag>"}` | fenced blocks in the issue body whose info string is `<tag>`, harvested and hashed at activation, one command per line |
| `{name, pre=true}` | runs at **claim**, with its result in the context bundle rather than judging the step |

A fence tag is opaque too: `source = "fence:checks"` harvests ```` ```checks ````
blocks and docket never knows what the word means. Fenced commands are matched
**per line**, each its own decision with its own recorded result.

Gate results are recorded as `{gate, ordinal, argv, exit, duration_ms, output,
truncated, verdict, pre, reason}` with `verdict ∈ {pass, fail, unmatched}`. A
`pre = true` gate's results ride in the claim response under `context.pre_gates`
— present only when the step declares them. A failing pre-gate does **not**
refuse the claim: it is a measurement the step consumes, and the judging is the
step's job. A later step reads the same rows by declaring
`inputs = ["<step>.gate-results"]` (see *Engine-produced inputs* above).

#### What a gate's child process sees

The child environment is **constructed, not inherited**: a variable is present
only because the allowlist names it (`PATH`, `HOME`, `USER`, `LOGNAME`, `SHELL`,
`LANG`, `LC_ALL`, `LC_CTYPE`, `TZ`, `TMPDIR`, `SSL_CERT_FILE`, `SSL_CERT_DIR`,
`XDG_CACHE_HOME`). An unset parent variable is omitted rather than set empty.
`DOCKET_TOKEN` and `DOCKET_PATH` are denied outright — a capability token in a
child would convert code execution into engine authority — and a spawn aborts
if either is ever found in the constructed set.

Docket then **sets** these itself:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `TERM` | always `dumb` — a gate's output is captured, not displayed, and inherited ANSI escapes would pollute the run report |
| `CI` | always `1`, the near-universal "non-interactive" convention |
| `DOCKET_GATE` | the gate name (opaque to core) |
| `DOCKET_REPO` | the repository root |
| `DOCKET_ISSUE` | `DKT-N`, the issue the gated step belongs to |
| `DOCKET_SCOPE` | the issue's declared scope globs, **newline-joined**; absent entirely when there are no globs to carry |
| `DOCKET_GATE_NETWORK` | the trust entry's declared hosts, comma-joined — set only when it declared any, alongside the proxy variables |

`DOCKET_ISSUE` and `DOCKET_SCOPE` are what let a **diff-shaped** gate evaluate
the change it is actually gating instead of the whole dirty tree. The globs are
newline-joined rather than JSON because the consumer is a shell check reading
its own environment, where `while IFS= read -r glob` needs no parser. **Absent
is not empty**: an issue that declared no scope gives the check no narrower
answer than the tree, and inventing one would be docket deciding what the issue
touches.

The variable carries globs or nothing, so it is the one surface where declaring
no scope and declaring an empty one look alike — a declared-but-empty scope
leaves `DOCKET_SCOPE` unset too, rather than setting it to the empty string.
Everywhere the two are distinguishable they stay distinguished: v1's `scope`
key, and the activation lint that warns about the first and not the second. A
gate that must tell them apart reads `docket issue show`, not its environment.

There is no way to extend the allowlist — no flag, no config key, no trust-entry
field.

### Action steps — computations, not workers

An `action` step has no worker. It declares a computation and `params.output`,
which is the artifact kind it produces:

```toml
[[step]]
name    = "reconcile"
after   = ["synthesize"]
action  = "aggregate"
inputs  = ["synthesize.findings"]
payload = "findings@1"
params  = { field = "severity", method = "median", hold_spread = 2, output = "findings" }
```

**Nothing claims an action step.** `docket step claim` refuses one with
`CONFLICT` — "resolved by the engine, not by a worker" — the same way it refuses
a `human` or `vote` gate. The engine runs it, records its artifact, and routes.
It still appears in `docket next --run` so a dispatcher can see what a run is
doing; the row simply carries no `executor` to spawn.

**Resolution is builtin-first.** `aggregate` is the one computation docket
performs itself; every other action name is looked up in your trust store and
run as a **user-trusted command**, through the same matching, argv resolution,
env allowlist, timeout, capture, and repo containment a gate goes through. There
are no exceptions and no second execution path. The name `aggregate` is
reserved, so a trust entry cannot shadow it — `workflow register` says so rather
than leaving you to wonder why your command never ran.

An unmatched action name records `verdict: "unmatched"` with null `argv` and
null `exit`, spawns nothing, and **fails the step**, which routes per `on_fail`.
A computation that could not run has not succeeded.

#### The trusted-command contract

| Direction | Shape |
|---|---|
| **stdin** | the step context object, exactly as `docket step context --json` emits it — one JSON document, then EOF |
| **stdout** | one JSON object `{"body": "<string>", "payload": [ … ]}`. `body` defaults to `""`, `payload` to `[]`. No other keys, one document |
| **exit 0** | success; the artifact records with `kind = params.output` |
| **non-zero exit** | failure; the step routes per `on_fail`, the captured output is recorded, and **no artifact is written** |
| **unparseable stdout on exit 0** | failure, with the first 200 bytes quoted back with control characters escaped |

An object rather than "stdout is the payload", because every artifact has a
human-readable body and a command needs a channel for it. `stderr` is the
diagnostic stream and is what `action_results.output` records; it cannot corrupt
the document docket parses.

If the step declares a `payload`, the produced payload is validated against that
schema exactly as a worker's is. A failure there is a step failure routed per
`on_fail`, not a refusal to a caller — there is no caller.

Every attempt is recorded as an **action result**:
`{action, ordinal, argv, exit, duration_ms, output, truncated, verdict, builtin,
reason}` with `verdict ∈ {pass, fail, unmatched}`. `builtin` marks a computation
docket performed itself, and `argv`/`exit` are null there because nothing
spawned. A `flaky` trust entry re-runs and each attempt gets its own row, with
the **last** one deciding the routing.

#### `aggregate` — the one builtin

`aggregate` reduces clustered values to one value per cluster, over an order
**your schema declares**. It works for severities, priorities, tiers, T-shirt
sizes, or ripeness grades alike: docket knows position, never significance.

| Param | Type | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `field` | string | yes | the payload property to reduce |
| `method` | `median` \| `max` \| `min` | yes | the reduction |
| `hold_spread` | integer ≥ 0, default 0 | no | hold when the spread reaches this; `0` never holds |
| `output` | string | yes | the artifact kind this step produces |

No other keys are accepted — a typo'd `method = "medain"` is refused at
`workflow register`, not discovered hours into a run.

An `aggregate` step **must** declare `payload = "name@version"`, and that
schema must mark `params.field` as `ordered_enum`. Median, max, and min are
defined only over an order, so an aggregate without one could never compute.

**The input.** The builtin reduces the **concatenated payloads of the step's
declared `inputs` artifacts**, resolved by the ordinary input rules — `done`
producers only, in declared order, and scoped to the step's own loop ordinal. So
`inputs = ["synthesize.findings"]` means "reduce what `synthesize` recorded".
`inputs` must be non-empty on an `aggregate` step, refused at `workflow
register`: a step with nothing to read can never compute.

Each element of that payload is one cluster. The element's `field` is either an
**array** of values — the cluster's members — or a **scalar**, which is a
one-member cluster. Every other key of the element is carried through verbatim.

Over a flat payload of scalars, `aggregate` is the **identity**: every value
passes through, nothing is held, nothing is demoted. You can introduce
clustering later without a behavior change anywhere else.

**The even-count rule.** With members sorted by their position in your declared
order, the reduction is `m[0]` for `min`, `m[len-1]` for `max`, and
`m[(len-1)/2]` for `median` — **the LOWER of the two central values when the
count is even**. So a cluster of `{low, blocker}` medians to `low`.

That is not caution. Docket does not know which end of your order is worse: a
rule that took "the more severe of the two" would be docket holding an opinion
about severities, which is simply wrong for a `confidence` or a `ripeness`
enum and invisible when it is. One expression, no special case, and the
standard lower median for ordinal data where no average exists.

**Spread and holds.** `spread` is the distance between the extreme members'
**positions** — so with `["info","low","medium","high","blocker"]`, both
`{low, high}` and `{low, medium, high}` have spread 2. A cluster holds when
`hold_spread > 0 && spread >= hold_spread`.

**The demotion trail.** When the computed value's position is strictly below its
highest member's, the output records `demoted_from` with the value that was not
taken. When nothing was demoted the key is **absent**, not empty. `max` never
demotes.

**The output**, one element per input element, validated against both the
shipped `aggregate@1` schema and your own:

```json
{ "severity": "medium", "members": ["low","medium","high"], "held": true,
  "demoted_from": "high", "operator_resolved": false, "…your other keys…": "…" }
```

#### Held clusters, and what you do about one

When `hold_spread` trips, docket materializes a `type="human"` step **per held
cluster**, named `<step>-held` at the same ordinal with the cluster's payload
index as its sibling suffix — `reconcile-held@0#0`, `reconcile-held@0#2`, … —
and the routing step **stops**. Concretely:

- The routing step's status stays `gated`, which is non-terminal, so every
  downstream step waits. Its threshold is **not** evaluated yet.
- Each held step is offered by `next --run` immediately, takes no claim and no
  token, and shows up as an ordinary human gate — or as a vote gate, when
  `vote.hold.*` is configured (see *Engine configuration*). Everything below is
  the same either way; a tally simply answers first, and escalates to the
  operator's verbs below when it does not pass.
- `guard stop` **denies** while any is open, exactly as it does for a declared
  human gate awaiting approval. Stopping means resolving or abandoning first.
- The step-name suffix `-held` is **reserved**: you cannot declare a step whose
  name ends in it.

**One step per cluster, so you can answer them differently.** A hold carrying
four clusters gives you four approve/reject decisions, not one. The suffix is
the cluster's index in the payload, which is stable across re-reads of the same
immutable artifact — so a resumed saga re-derives the same step for the same
cluster, and a cluster that was never held has no step. (A hold where only the
second cluster trips materializes `#1` and no `#0`.)

| `docket step approve <held> [--note N] [--value V]` | records a **new** artifact on the routing step with `operator_resolved: true` on **that cluster**, marks the held step `done` |
| `docket step reject <held> [--note N]` | records **no** artifact for that cluster, marks the held step `done` |

**`--value V` is the corrected value for the cluster's aggregated field.** It
lands on the **field itself**, so every threshold and every downstream input
routes on the number the operator actually endorsed, and the computed value it
replaced is recorded beside it as `operator_set_from` — the two records stay
distinguishable rather than one overwriting the other. `--note`, when given,
travels with the decision as `operator_note` on the same element, so a fixer
reading the resolved payload learns *what was decided* and not merely *that a
decision happened*.

| Rule about `--value` | |
|---|---|
| It is validated against the **pinned schema's declared enum** before anything is written | a correction must be a member of the membership set the run agreed to; a value outside it is a `VALIDATION_ERROR` |
| It is **never parsed from `--note`** | docket does not read a disposition out of prose. Refusing to infer one was always right; what it argued for was a structured field, not no field |
| It accompanies **approve** only | reject records no artifact for the cluster, so there is no value to set — `--value` with `reject` is a `VALIDATION_ERROR` |
| It applies to **materialized** `<step>-held` steps only | a declared human gate has no payload of its own to correct, so the flag would reach nothing there; that too is a `VALIDATION_ERROR` naming the step |
| The routing step must declare an aggregated field and a `payload` schema | otherwise there is no field to set and no enum to check against |

The value rides in the `step-approved` event beside the note, so the feed's
account of the decision carries the decision's content.

The routing step waits until **every** cluster has an answer, then routes once:
per its effective `on_fail` if **any** cluster was rejected, otherwise through
the threshold over the resolved payload. Reject is the escalating answer, so a
mixed set does not silently pass — but each cluster keeps its own status,
routing, and note, so the record stays per-cluster even though what routes is
one decision.

Approval means *accept the cluster* — at the computed value, or at the one
`--value` names. The originally-held artifact stays addressable forever: what
docket computed and what you accepted are two records, not one overwritten one.

A step parked because its clusters were **rejected** cannot be retried:
`docket step resolve --as retry` refuses there rather than silently re-parking
it. The rejection is sticky — re-running the aggregate re-reads the same
rejected decision and routes to the same place, so the attempt counter was never
what blocked it. What moves such a step is `override-pass`, `skip`, or
`abandon-issue`, and the rejected verdict stays addressable through all three.

A loop entry supersedes an unresolved held step along with everything else at
that ordinal — the question was about that ordinal's computation, and the loop
has moved past it.

### Fanout and joins

A `fanout` step expands to one sibling per hint, in declared order:
`review@0#0 … review@0#3`. A step declaring `after = ["review"]` waits for the
**join**, and the rules are worth knowing exactly:

| Rule | Behavior |
|---|---|
| The join releases when **every** sibling is terminal | terminal means `done`, `skipped`, `superseded`, or `failed-routed`. A sibling that ended any of those ways has ended; waiting for all of them to be `done` would deadlock on the first one that failed or was skipped. |
| A sibling in `waiting-human` **parks the issue** | `waiting-human` is not terminal, so the join stays open until an operator resolves it with `docket step resolve`. |
| Downstream `inputs` resolve over **`done` siblings only** | a sibling that failed produced no result, so its artifact is not an input. |
| `on_fail` applies **per sibling** | one sibling failing routes that sibling. The other three still finish on their own terms. |
| `min_siblings` is a **quorum**, compared after the join | if fewer than `min_siblings` siblings are `done` once every sibling is terminal, the fanned step routes per its `on_fail`. |

**`min_siblings` does not cancel early.** Reaching the quorum does not release
the join: docket waits for every sibling to finish and *then* compares. A
4-way fanout with `min_siblings = 2` and two siblings already `done` still waits
for the other two. This is deliberate for v1 — cancelling work that is already
running, to save time on a quorum that is already met, is a decision docket
declines to make on your behalf.

### Loops

A `threshold` (or an `on_fail`) that routes `fix-loop` enters a loop. There is
**no other loop construct** — a threshold routing to a *step name* interposes
that step as a one-off gate and is not a loop.

What happens on loop entry, in one transaction:

1. **The issue's loop counter increments.** The counter is per-issue, not
   per-step. If the new count would exceed `max_fix_loops`, the routing becomes
   `waiting-human` instead and no loop is entered — loops are bounded by
   construction, and the parked step's routing records why.
2. **Unclaimed work downstream of `after_loop` is superseded.** Instances at a
   lower ordinal that are still `pending` become `superseded` — a terminal
   status, not a deletion. Already-claimed and running instances are **left
   alone to finish**; their eventual routing is recorded for the ledger but
   applies no downstream effect, so a slow step from the previous ordinal cannot
   re-route an issue that has already moved on.
3. **`loop = true` steps instantiate at the new ordinal**, along with the
   `after_loop` step and everything transitively after it. Gates re-run and
   thresholds re-apply on the new instances — they are fresh, with no gate trail
   and no routing carried over.

Steps **upstream** of `after_loop` do not re-run. That is why `inputs` bind
**per input**: a step at ordinal 1 resolves each declared input at ordinal 1 if
something produced it there, and otherwise falls back to the highest earlier
ordinal that did. The fixture's `fix` step binds `reconcile.findings` fresh at
ordinal 1 and `implement.change-summary` from ordinal 0, in the same step.

**Issue completion is evaluated over highest-ordinal instances only.** A `done`
step at ordinal 0 whose ordinal-1 instance is still pending does not count as
finished, and superseded ordinal-0 instances do not block completion. Prior
instances and their artifacts stay immutable and addressable for the ledger.

## Workflow: Payload schemas (`docket schema`)

A step can declare `payload = "name@version"`. That names a **payload schema**:
a JSON Schema document you register, against which the step's `--payload-file`
is checked, and — this is the part that matters — the place where **order comes
from**.

Docket's threshold predicates include ordered comparisons: `any(risk >= medium)`.
Docket does not know that `medium` outranks `low`. It knows it because your
schema said so.

```bash
docket schema register risk-report@1 .docket/config/schemas/risk-report.json
docket schema list
docket schema show risk-report@1 --body
```

### The `ordered_enum` annotation

An ordinary JSON Schema, plus one key:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "type": "array",
  "items": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "risk": {
        "type": "string",
        "enum": ["info", "low", "medium", "high", "blocker"],
        "ordered_enum": true
      }
    },
    "required": ["risk"]
  }
}
```

| Rule | |
|---|---|
| The order **is** the `enum` array, as written, ascending | there is no second list to disagree with it, and adding a value to `enum` cannot leave the order stale |
| `ordered_enum` must sit beside an `enum` of **at least two unique strings** | otherwise it is a `VALIDATION_ERROR` naming the property path |
| It constrains **nothing** | a document that validated before the annotation validates after it; the annotation declares position, not a new rule |
| Only **top-level properties of the array's item schema** are indexed | that is exactly what a threshold predicate's bare field token can name |

Docket learns *position*, never *significance*. It does not know which end of
your order is worse, more urgent, or better — and it never has to. A median over
a declared order is the same computation for risk levels, priorities, tiers,
T-shirt sizes, or ripeness grades.

A payload is an array of objects. A schema over it is therefore usually
`{"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", …}}` — and a document that is not
that shape still registers, it simply declares nothing a threshold can name.

### Registration is content-addressed and immutable

Exactly as workflows are:

| Second registration of… | Result |
|---|---|
| the same bytes | success, returns the existing row, changes nothing |
| **different** bytes at the same `name@version` | `CONFLICT` (exit 4), naming both hashes |
| any bytes at a new `version` | an ordinary registration |

To change a schema, register a new version. This is not ceremony: a schema
decides whether a worker's payload is *accepted*, so a mutable `risk-report@1`
would change a running job's acceptance criteria mid-flight. A workflow that
wants the new schema declares it and bumps its own `[pipeline].version`.

Registering `risk-report@2` does nothing to a workflow that declares
`payload = "risk-report@1"`. Version references are exact.

### Register schemas before the workflows that name them

A workflow declaring `payload = "risk-report@1"` is **checked against the
registered schema when you register the workflow**, not later:

| Check | What it refuses |
|---|---|
| the schema is registered | `payload` naming something absent — with the `docket schema register` line to run |
| the field exists | `any(rsk >= medium)` when the schema declares `risk`, listing what it does declare |
| the literal is valid | `any(risk == severe)` when the enum is `low, medium, high` |
| ordered means ordered | `any(stage >= final)` when `stage` declares an `enum` but no `ordered_enum` |

So register schemas first. A workflow that could never route correctly should
not register at all — the alternative is discovering a typo hours into a run, on
a step whose work is already done.

**Auto-registration already does this for you.** Activation registers everything
under `.docket/config/schemas/` before anything under `.docket/config/workflows/`,
so a workflow and the schema it names can live side by side in the same tree and
the ordering is never yours to arrange. The rule above matters when you register
by hand, and as the reason the auto-registration order is what it is.

**A threshold on a step with no `payload` is untouched by all of this.** It is
grammar-checked and nothing more, and at runtime an ordered comparison over a
field with no declared order parks the step for a human rather than guessing.
`any(status == unmet)` never needed a schema to be correct, and still does not:
equality has never needed an order.

**Changing a schema does not change an already-registered workflow.**
`payload = "risk-report@1"` names a version. Registering `risk-report@2` creates
a new row and touches nothing; a workflow that wants it declares it and bumps its
own `[pipeline].version`. That is worth knowing because "the schema was updated"
is the first thing anyone assumes when a threshold behaves as it did yesterday.

### The one shipped schema

`docket schema list` reports one row in a fresh repo:

```
aggregate@1                  1e0a0be39394  builtin
```

`aggregate@1` ships with docket and describes the output of the builtin
`aggregate` action step. It is inert unless such a step runs, and nothing else
in the registry arrives without someone registering it.

### Validation at `complete`

A step that declares `payload = "name@version"` has its `--payload-file`
validated when it completes:

```
Error: step assess@0: payload does not satisfy risk-report@1:
  payload[3].risk: value "urgent" is not one of ["info","low","medium","high","blocker"]
  (+2 more)
```

Three things about that refusal are deliberate:

- **It is path-precise.** `payload[3].risk` is the element and the property, in
  the notation the file itself is written in. "The payload is invalid" would be
  something a worker can only re-submit against blindly.
- **It is capped at five lines.** A worker's log is not improved by a hundred,
  and the count of what was dropped is reported so you know the list is partial.
- **It validates against the bytes the RUN PINNED**, not against whatever the
  registry holds now. Two runs of the same work at the same pins reach the same
  verdict on the same payload.

Authorization is checked first, always: a caller that does not hold the step's
token gets `AUTH_ERROR` and learns nothing about the schema.

### `docket schema` refusals

| Situation | Code | Exit |
|---|---|---|
| Schema file not found or unreadable | `NOT_FOUND` | 2 |
| Reference is not `name@version` with a version ≥ 1 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 3 |
| Malformed JSON, or a document that does not compile as JSON Schema | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 3 |
| `ordered_enum` without a usable sibling `enum` | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 3, naming the property path |
| Re-registering different bytes at an existing `name@version` | `CONFLICT` | 4 |
| `schema show` on an unregistered name or version | `NOT_FOUND` | 2 |
| `--payload-file` fails the step's declared schema at `complete` | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 3 |
| `--payload-file` omitted on a step that declares `payload` | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 3 |

## Workflow: Voting (`docket vote`, consensus proposals)

**A workflow step can open one of these.** A `type="vote"` step creates a
proposal when it becomes ready, fans out to the voters it names, and routes on
the outcome — `approved` passes the step, `rejected` routes per its `on_fail`,
which such a step must declare explicitly (V13a). `waiting-human` is legal there
and means *escalate to an operator*, unlike on a human gate where it is refused.
The proposal's id rides on the step row as `proposal`, and the roster as
`voters`, so a caller holding a `next` row can cast without reading the pinned
definition. Nothing about the machinery below changes: voters cast with the same
`docket vote cast` shown here, the tally is the same weighted score and quorum,
and there is **no new verb**. The step names a `vote_rule`, which is a pair of
`vote.rule.<name>.*` config keys, and `required_voters` is the length of its own
`voters` list. Nothing casts a vote automatically — a voter is a person or a
process running the CLI.

Create a proposal:

```bash
docket vote create --json \
  -d "Adopt Result<T,E> for all internal/db error returns" \
  -r "Panics currently propagate uncaught in 3 call sites" \
  -c high -n 3 --threshold 0.67 \
  --domain-tags "database,error-handling" \
  --files-changed "internal/db/issue.go,internal/db/doc.go"
```

Cast a vote:

```bash
docket vote cast DKT-V1 --json \
  -v approve --confidence 0.9 --domain-relevance 0.8 \
  --findings "Reviewed all call sites, no blockers" \
  --summary "LGTM" \
  --metadata '{"model_resolved":"claude-sonnet-5","effort_resolved":"high"}'
```

`--metadata` is optional and opaque: a seat records what produced its vote
there, and the value is stored whole and read by nobody. Pass it whenever the
vote was cast by something whose spend an operator may later want to attribute.
Treat the value as public — it is visible to anyone who can list processes, it
is stored verbatim in the store, and `docket export` re-emits it verbatim with
no redaction. It reads back through `vote show --json`, `vote result --json`,
and the export document; the human-readable tables do not render it.

Valid `--verdict`/`-v` values: `approve`, `approve-with-concerns`, `reject`.
Valid `--criticality`/`-c` values: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`.
`--confidence` and `--domain-relevance` are floats in `[0.0, 1.0]`.

Inspect and finalize:

```bash
docket vote show DKT-V1 --json
docket vote result DKT-V1 --json
docket vote list --json --all               # default: open proposals only
docket vote commit DKT-V1 --json --outcome "Approved: adopting Result<T,E>"
docket vote link DKT-V1 --json --issue DKT-1
docket vote unlink DKT-V1 --json --issue DKT-1
```

---

## Workflow: Docs (`docket doc`)

```bash
docket doc create --json -t "ADR-0003: SQLite over Postgres" -T adr -s accepted \
  -d "@docs/adr/0003-sqlite.md"          # "@path" loads body from a file
docket doc create --json -t "Quick note" -d "-"   # "-" reads body from stdin
docket doc show DOC-1 --json
docket doc show DOC-1 --json --rev 2               # a specific revision
docket doc list --json -T adr -s accepted
docket doc edit DOC-1 --json -s superseded
docket doc delete DOC-1 --json --force
docket doc link add DOC-1 --json --issue DKT-1
docket doc link remove DOC-1 --json --issue DKT-1
docket doc comment add DOC-1 --json -m "Needs a follow-up on migration path"
docket doc comment list DOC-1 --json
```

`--description`/`-d` on `doc create`/`doc edit` supports the same three
input modes as `issue create -d`: literal string, `@path/to/file` (loads
file contents, 1 MiB cap), or `-` (stdin, 1 MiB cap).

---

## Workflow: Watch Mode

Any watch-eligible command (see table above) can be re-run on an interval
instead of polling manually:

```bash
docket issue list --json --watch --interval 5s
docket board --watch                       # human-mode live board, default 2s interval
docket vote result DKT-V1 --watch --interval 1s
```

`--watch` is rejected with `VALIDATION_ERROR` on any write command (e.g.
`docket issue create --watch` fails immediately). Watch mode runs until
`Ctrl-C` (SIGINT) or SIGTERM.

---

## Workflow: Export / Import

```bash
docket export --json -o json -f backup.json
docket export -o csv -f issues.csv -s todo -s in-progress
docket export -o markdown > issues.md

docket import backup.json --json --merge          # skip duplicates by ID
docket import backup.json --json --replace --yes  # destructive: wipes DB first; --yes is required
                                                    # in every output mode, --json never substitutes (DKT-15)
docket import backup.json --json                  # default: requires an EMPTY database, else CONFLICT
```

`export` streams to stdout when `-f`/`--file` is omitted. `import` requires
`--merge` XOR `--replace`, or an empty database — passing both is a
`VALIDATION_ERROR`, and importing into a non-empty DB without either flag
is a `CONFLICT`.

---

## Complete Command & Flag Reference

Every flag below is transcribed directly from the `cmd.Flags().*` calls in
the corresponding `internal/cli/*.go` file's `init()`. "Req." marks flags
enforced via `cmd.Flags().MarkFlagRequired` (Cobra rejects the command
before `RunE` runs if absent) — distinct from flags that are merely
required *in JSON mode* by manual checks inside `RunE` (noted in Notes).

### `docket issue` (alias `i`) — `internal/cli/issue.go`

#### `docket issue create` — `issue_create.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--title` | `-t` | string | `""` | Required in `--json` mode |
| `--description` | `-d` | string | `""` | `"-"` reads from stdin |
| `--status` | `-s` | string | `"backlog"` | |
| `--priority` | `-p` | string | `"none"` | |
| `--type` | `-T` | string | `"task"` | |
| `--label` | `-l` | stringSlice | `nil` | repeatable |
| `--file` | `-f` | stringSlice | `nil` | repeatable |
| `--assignee` | `-a` | string | `""` | |
| `--parent` | — | string | `""` | parent issue ID |
| `--scope` | — | stringSlice | `nil` | repeatable; path glob this issue is expected to touch |
| `--idempotency-key` | — | string | `""` | replay protection; repeat returns the original issue |

#### `docket issue edit [id]` — `issue_edit.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--title` | `-t` | string | `""` | only applied when explicitly set |
| `--description` | `-d` | string | `""` | `"-"` reads from stdin |
| `--status` | `-s` | string | `""` | |
| `--priority` | `-p` | string | `""` | |
| `--type` | `-T` | string | `""` | |
| `--assignee` | `-a` | string | `""` | |
| `--file` | `-f` | stringSlice | `nil` | repeatable; **replaces** existing file list |
| `--parent` | — | string | `""` | `"0"` or `"none"` clears parent |
| `--scope` | — | stringSlice | `nil` | repeatable; **replaces** the declaration, `--scope=` clears it |
| `--if-version` | — | int | `0` | apply only at this version; `CONFLICT` otherwise |

**`--scope` is not `--file`.** `--file` records the concrete paths an issue
concerns, and `docket plan` uses them to split colliding work. `--scope` is a
list of path **globs** declaring what an issue is *expected* to touch — a
judgment made ahead of the work, which activation snapshots and which the
scheduler will use for mutual exclusion between steps. They differ in
cardinality, in semantics (actual vs. intended), and in matching rule (equality
vs. glob intersection).

An issue created without `--scope` stores SQL `NULL`, not `[]`: "no scope
declared" and "declared to touch nothing" are different facts. An `issue edit`
that never mentions `--scope` leaves an earlier declaration alone.

**Reading it back:** `issue show` and `issue list` carry `scope` **when the
issue declares one**, under plain `--json` as well as `--json=v2` — the one
amendment to the v1 freeze (DKT-55, see above). The three states are
distinguishable on the wire: no key at all is undeclared, `[]` is
declared-to-touch-nothing, and a populated array is the declaration. A
declared scope also survives `export`/`import` intact, `NULL` included.

#### `docket issue show [id]` — `issue_show.go`

No local flags. Watch-eligible.

#### `docket issue list` (alias `ls`) — `issue_list.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--status` | `-s` | stringSlice | `nil` | repeatable |
| `--priority` | `-p` | stringSlice | `nil` | repeatable |
| `--label` | `-l` | stringSlice | `nil` | repeatable |
| `--type` | `-T` | stringSlice | `nil` | repeatable |
| `--assignee` | `-a` | string | `""` | |
| `--parent` | — | string | `""` | |
| `--roots` | — | bool | `false` | root issues only |
| `--tree` | — | bool | `false` | indented hierarchy |
| `--sort` | — | string | `""` | `field:direction`, e.g. `priority:asc` |
| `--limit` | — | int | `50` | |
| `--all` | — | bool | `false` | include `done` issues |

Watch-eligible.

#### `docket issue close [id]` — `issue_close.go`

Shorthand for `move <id> done`.

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--if-version` | — | int | `0` | apply only at this version; `CONFLICT` otherwise |

Ends a live lease. The holder must supply its token (`DOCKET_TOKEN` or stdin);
a non-holder gets `AUTH_ERROR` (exit 5). An unclaimed issue needs no token.

#### `docket issue claim <id>` — `issue_claim.go`

Takes a lease and mints a capability token, returned exactly once.

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--owner` | — | string | — | **required**; identifies the lease holder |
| `--ttl` | — | duration | configured | lease duration; overrides the configured TTL |
| `--class` | — | string | `""` | executor class whose configured TTL applies (opaque) |

Response (`--json`): `{"issue":"DKT-N","token":"<64 hex>","lease_expires_ms":N}`.
Under `--json=v2` it also carries `attempt` and `version`. Exit 4 if a live
lease is held; exit 2 if the issue does not exist.

#### `docket issue heartbeat <id>` — `issue_heartbeat.go`

Extends a lease you hold. Token via `DOCKET_TOKEN` or stdin. Does not change
`attempt` — a heartbeat is not a new claim.

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--ttl` | — | duration | configured | extension length |
| `--class` | — | string | `""` | executor class whose configured TTL applies |

#### `docket issue release <id>` — `issue_release.go`

Releases a lease you hold, returning the issue to the unclaimed pool
immediately. No local flags. Token via `DOCKET_TOKEN` or stdin. `attempt`
survives; the released token never works again.

#### `docket issue move <id> <status>` — `issue_move.go`

Two modes: a **status move** (two positional args, `id` and target status) or
a **project migration** (`<id>` plus `--project`, no status arg).

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--if-version` | — | int | `0` | apply only at this version; `CONFLICT` otherwise (enforced even on a no-op move). Status moves only — with `--project` it is a `VALIDATION_ERROR` |
| `--project` | — | string | `""` | migrate the issue **and its whole sub-issue tree** to another project in the shared store |

**Migration (`--project`)** re-homes work that landed in the wrong project —
most commonly a gap recorded by `step complete --gap-file`, which lands in the
run's own project unconditionally. The target resolves in order: exact
`identity`, then numeric `id`, then unique `name`, then unique `prefix` (the
name/prefix matches are case-insensitive); an ambiguous name or prefix is a
`VALIDATION_ERROR` pointing at `docket project list`. Labels re-map **by
name** into the target project (created there when missing, color preserved);
comments, relations, and activity ride along untouched — ids are store-wide,
so nothing referencing the issue goes stale. The response carries the target
project and the full list of migrated ids.

| Refusal | Code | Exit |
|---|---|---|
| a status arg **and** `--project` together | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 3 |
| the issue has a parent — a sub-issue migrates with its root, never alone (migrate the root, or `issue edit --parent none` first) | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 3 |
| the issue (or any sub-issue) belongs to a run — a run's snapshots and steps are project-scoped bookkeeping | `CONFLICT` | 4 |
| issue not found | `NOT_FOUND` | 2 |

#### `docket issue reopen [id]` — `issue_reopen.go`

Only transitions if currently `done`, sets status to `backlog`.

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--if-version` | — | int | `0` | apply only at this version; `CONFLICT` otherwise |

#### `docket issue delete <id>` — `issue_delete.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--force` | `-f` | bool | `false` | cascade-delete sub-issues; mutually exclusive with `--orphan` |
| `--orphan` | — | bool | `false` | promote sub-issues to root; mutually exclusive with `--force` |

#### `docket issue log [id]` — `issue_log.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--limit` | — | int | `20` | clamped to min 1 |

Watch-eligible.

#### `docket issue comment add [id]` / `docket issue comment list [id]` — `issue_comment.go`, `issue_comment_list.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--message` | `-m` | string | `""` | (`add` only) required in `--json` mode if stdin isn't piped |
| `--idempotency-key` | — | string | `""` | (`add` only) replay protection |

`comment list` has no local flags; watch-eligible.

#### `docket issue file add/remove/list` — `issue_file.go`

`add <id> <file-path>...` and `remove <id> <file-path>...` take
`cobra.MinimumNArgs(2)` — no flags. `list <id>` takes `cobra.ExactArgs(1)` —
no flags.

#### `docket issue link add/remove/list` — `issue_link.go`

`add <id> <relation> <target_id>` and `remove <id> <relation> <target_id>`
take `cobra.ExactArgs(3)` — no flags. `list <id>` — no flags.

#### `docket issue label add/rm/list/delete` — `issue_label.go`

| Command | Flag | Short | Type | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `add <id> <label>...` | `--color` | — | string | `""` |
| `rm <id> <label>...` | — | — | — | no flags |
| `list` | — | — | — | no flags |
| `delete <label>` | `--force` | `-f` | bool | `false` |

#### `docket issue graph [id]` — `issue_graph.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--depth` | — | int | `0` | `0` = unlimited |
| `--direction` | — | string | `"both"` | `up`\|`down`\|`both` |
| `--mermaid` | — | bool | `false` | Mermaid flowchart output (ignored in `--json`) |

Watch-eligible.

### `docket plan` — `plan.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--root` | — | string | `""` | scope to a parent issue subtree |
| `--status` | `-s` | stringSlice | `nil` | repeatable |
| `--label` | `-l` | stringSlice | `nil` | repeatable |
| `--priority` | `-p` | stringSlice | `nil` | repeatable |
| `--type` | `-T` | stringSlice | `nil` | repeatable |
| `--assignee` | `-a` | string | `""` | |

Watch-eligible. Cycle in the dependency graph → `CONFLICT`. `--json` output
additionally includes per-issue `blocked_by` (array of formatted blocker IDs,
`[]` if none), per-phase `level` (1-based topological-level index —
sub-phases produced by splitting one topo-level across file collisions share
the same `level`), and top-level `total_levels` (count of distinct levels).
Human/plain rendering distinguishes a same-level file-collision split
("Phase N (same dependency level as Phase N-1, split by file collision):")
from a genuine new dependency level ("Phase N (parallel, after Phase N-1):").

### `docket next` — `next.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--status` | `-s` | stringSlice | `nil` | default ready-set is `backlog`,`todo` if unset |
| `--priority` | `-p` | stringSlice | `nil` | repeatable |
| `--label` | `-l` | stringSlice | `nil` | repeatable |
| `--type` | `-T` | stringSlice | `nil` | repeatable |
| `--limit` | — | int | `10` | |
| `--run` | — | string | `""` | switches to STEP mode: lists a run's offer (ready steps + staged closure) |

Watch-eligible.

**Two modes.** Without `--run` this is the issue-mode verb, unchanged. With
`--run RUN-N` it lists that run's OFFER instead, in the `next row` shape
below: the claimable steps **plus their staged dependency closure** — rows
carried ahead of their own readiness (`status: staged`), leveled by `stage`,
so a dispatcher sees whole dependency chains rather than one frontier at a
time. The offer **rations class headroom**: a class with a finite `[limits]
max` contributes at most that many rows, so fewer same-class rows than ready
steps is the offer working, not a bug. The issue filters (`--status`,
`--priority`, `--label`, `--type`) are
**refused** in step mode with `VALIDATION_ERROR` rather than silently ignored —
a filter that quietly does nothing is one a dispatcher would trust and be wrong
about.

Step mode may WRITE: it reaps expired step leases, returning them to the ready
pool, and it auto-abandons a dispatch manifest that has outlived its TTL. Lease
reaping happens here and at `step claim` and nowhere else; the dispatch
auto-abandon happens here alone (`claim` never retires a manifest — a dispatch
is about a *batch*, and letting a single-step verb expire one would let a claim
silently unwedge a run whose relay is still alive).

**Step mode REFUSES rather than returning an empty list.** An empty ready set
means "nothing to do"; a refusal means "I will not answer until you reconcile",
and a dispatcher cannot tell those apart from a zero-length array. Each refusal
is `CONFLICT` (exit 4):

| Refusal | When | The way out |
|---|---|---|
| open dispatch | a manifest is open for the run and has not expired | `docket dispatch close`, `docket dispatch abandon`, or wait for `dispatch.ttl` — the message names all three plus the dispatch and its expiry |
| `claimed-but-unrecorded` | a step is `claimed`/`running` and has been silent longer than `dispatch.grace` | **lease expiry clears it**: the lease lapses, the next `next` reaps the step, and the discrepancy dissolves. The message names the expiry time |
| `usage-rows-missing` | a step finished after the run was activated with no recorded usage, **in a run that has ever opened a dispatch** | record the usage with `docket dispatch backfill-usage` (or `step complete --usage` at the time), or `docket dispatch close --accept-missing-usage`, which records the acceptance but does **not** clear the discrepancy |

The reap runs *before* the refusal is evaluated, so a step this invocation frees
is never reported as a discrepancy naming a resolution that has already
happened.

**Discrepancies are a property of the run, not of a manifest** — a relay that
never opened a dispatch can still leave a claimed step unrecorded. But
`usage-rows-missing` applies only to runs with dispatch history: a run no relay
ever drove has nobody owing usage, so a solo operator who completes steps
without `--usage` is never refused.

Issue mode (`docket next` with no `--run`) probes none of this and is
byte-identical to what it was before dispatches existed.

`next --run` also names any unacknowledged write-class reaps on **stderr**, with
the flag that clears them — a headroom denial with nothing running is otherwise
baffling. The JSON payload is unchanged by it.

The `next row` shape (engine-spec §11.4):

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `step` | `STEP-N` id |
| `instance` | rendered `name@k#i` identity |
| `issue` / `run` | `DKT-N` / `RUN-N` |
| `kind` | `executor` \| `action` \| `human` \| `vote` |
| `executor` | opaque hint; **absent** on human and vote steps |
| `labels` | the issue's labels, for label-keyed routing policy; **omitted** when the issue has none |
| `voters` | the step's opaque voter list; **present only on vote steps** |
| `proposal` | `DKT-VN` of the proposal this vote step opened; **absent** until it is opened |
| `class` | opaque concurrency-accounting key |
| `attempt` | claims made against this step, ever |
| `expected_cost` | declared cost; accrues to the run's budget floor when this step is claimed |
| `lease_ttl_s` | lease TTL in **seconds** |
| `stage` | start-order constraint **within this offer**: do not start a row until every lower-stage row in the set has completed; rows sharing a stage run concurrently. `0` (omitted) means unstaged. NOT a priority — for `ready` rows it is a hint, for `staged` rows `claim` itself enforces the predicate |
| `conditional` | `true` on a staged row sitting (transitively) behind a HOLD-CAPABLE in-offer predecessor — an `aggregate` declaring `hold_spread`, whose completion may hold for an operator instead of routing. Advisory, like `stage`: confirm the predecessor actually ROUTED before spawning such a row, or defer it to the next offer — spawning at the stage boundary risks paying a full boot for a claim refusal. Omitted when false |
| `status` | effective status, never stored — `ready`, or `staged` on a closure row offered ahead of its readiness (claimable only once its lower-stage predecessors record) |
| `metadata` | the definition's opaque KV, verbatim |

### `docket workflow` (alias `wf`) — `workflow.go`

#### `docket workflow register <file.toml>` — `workflow_register.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--json` | — | string | `""` | inherited; `v1` or `v2` |

Positional argument is required; `-` reads the definition from stdin. Parses,
validates, and lints, then inserts at `name@version`. Identical bytes at an
existing `name@version` are an idempotent success returning the existing row;
differing bytes are `CONFLICT` (exit 4) naming both hashes.

#### `docket workflow lint <file.toml>` — `workflow_lint.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--json` | — | string | `""` | inherited; `v1` or `v2` |

Positional argument is required; `-` reads the definition from stdin. Runs the
exact validation `register` runs and **writes nothing** — no row, no frozen
`name@version`. The answer is `{name, version, sha256, registration}` with
`registration` ∈ `new` \| `unchanged`; different bytes at an existing
`name@version` is `CONFLICT` (exit 4) naming both hashes and the version to bump
to, which **fails** the lint rather than reporting a third `registration` value.

#### `docket workflow deprecate <name>@<version>` — `workflow_deprecate.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--restore` | — | bool | `false` | return a retired version to binding |

Retires one registered version from binding without deleting it; the row stays
readable and runs that pinned it are unaffected. The version is **required** —
a bare name is a `VALIDATION_ERROR` (exit 3), since it would silently mean
whichever version is highest today. An already-retired version is `CONFLICT`
(exit 4); an unregistered name or version is `NOT_FOUND` (exit 2).

#### `docket workflow list` (alias `ls`) — `workflow_list.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--name` | — | string | `""` | filter to one workflow name |
| `--limit` | — | int | `50` | `0` means no limit |

**Every** registered version of each name is listed, not only the binding one —
the query reduces nothing — so lineage is visible rather than inferred.

A `Collection`: under `--json=v2` the payload is `{items, total, truncated}`,
where `total` is the true pre-limit count. Items carry `row_version` (the CAS
column) under v2 only; `version` is always the definition's version.

v2 items also carry **`deprecated_at_ms`**, the moment a version was retired
from binding. It is **omitted while the version still binds** — a field that is
not a fact does not appear — so binding eligibility is readable from list output
instead of every registered version rendering alike. v1 does not carry it; human
mode marks the row `[deprecated]` instead.

#### `docket workflow show <name>[@<version>]` — `workflow_show.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--source` | — | bool | `false` | emit the stored TOML verbatim |

Omitting `@version` selects the highest registered version. A malformed ref
(`name@`, `name@x`, `name@0`) is a `VALIDATION_ERROR` (exit 3); an
unregistered name or version is `NOT_FOUND` (exit 2). `--source` returns the
exact registered bytes — the ones `source_sha256` hashes.

A retired version still resolves here, carrying `deprecated_at_ms` under
`--json=v2` (omitted while it binds) and a `status: DEPRECATED` line in human
mode. Retirement is a binding-time filter, not a retraction.

#### `docket workflow init` — `workflow_init.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--template` | — | string | `"standard-dev"` | `standard-dev` \| `parallel-check` |
| `--dir` | — | string | `""` | defaults to `.docket/config/workflows` |
| `--force` | — | bool | `false` | overwrite an existing file |

Needs no database, so it works before `docket init` does. Creates the
directory tree if absent. Refusing to overwrite is `CONFLICT` (exit 4) naming
the existing path; an unknown template is `VALIDATION_ERROR` (exit 3) listing
the available ones.

None of the `workflow` verbs are watch-eligible; `--watch` on any of them is a
`VALIDATION_ERROR`.

### `docket schema` — `schema.go`

#### `docket schema register <name@version> <file.json>` — `schema_register.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--json` | — | string | `""` | inherited; `v1` or `v2` |

Both positional arguments are required. `name@version` uses the same grammar a
step's `payload` field does, so what a workflow may reference and what the
registry accepts cannot drift. The document is compiled as JSON Schema **here**,
at registration — a schema that does not compile is refused while an author is
looking at it, not hours into a run. The `ordered_enum` index is derived once
and stored beside the bytes it came from. Identical bytes at an existing
`name@version` are an idempotent success returning the existing row; differing
bytes are `CONFLICT` (exit 4) naming both hashes.

#### `docket schema list` (alias `ls`) — `schema_list.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--name` | — | string | `""` | filter to one schema name |
| `--limit` | — | int | `50` | `0` means no limit |

A `Collection`: under `--json=v2` the payload is `{items, total, truncated}`,
where `total` is the true pre-limit count. Each row carries `name`, `version`,
`source_sha256`, `ordered_fields`, `builtin`, and `created_at_ms`; `row_version`
appears under v2 only.

#### `docket schema show <name>[@<version>]` — `schema_show.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--body` | — | bool | `false` | emit the stored schema document verbatim |

Omitting `@version` selects the highest registered version. An unregistered name
or version is `NOT_FOUND` (exit 2). `--body` returns the exact registered
bytes — the ones `source_sha256` hashes and the ones a run validates payloads
against, so `docket schema show risk-report@1 --body > risk-report.json` round-trips.

None of the `schema` verbs are watch-eligible; `--watch` on any of them is a
`VALIDATION_ERROR`.

### `docket run` — `run.go`

A run binds registered workflows to issues and schedules their steps. Runs
follow `planning → active ⇄ waiting-human → done | abandoned`; run IDs are
formatted `RUN-<n>` and, like issue IDs, accept the bare number too.

#### `docket run start` — `run_start.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--issue` | — | stringSlice | `nil` | issue to attach (repeatable) |
| `--request-file` | — | string | `""` | file holding the run's request text |
| `--budget` | — | float64 | `0` | per-run cap, **enforced**, in the unit `budget.unit` names (see `docket run budget --help`); `0` means unlimited |

Creates a run in `planning`: nothing is bound, nothing is pinned, and no step
exists until `run activate`. The run records the resolved **exec root** and
the git branch/HEAD at start — what diff recording and the activation routing
lint later resolve against, pinned here so the answer never depends on where a
later invocation happened to stand. A malformed or absent `--issue` refuses
**before** the run is created, so a typo leaves no empty run behind. A
negative `--budget` is `VALIDATION_ERROR` (exit 3); a missing `--request-file`
is `NOT_FOUND` (exit 2).

The issue set is **not fixed here** — `docket run issue add|remove` edits it
afterwards (see below).

**The cap is enforced against `max(reported usage, declared-cost floor)`.** The
floor is the sum of `expected_cost` over the run's claimed steps, accrued per
claim from facts the engine produced itself — so a worker that reports nothing
cannot spend past the cap. Reported usage can only **raise** the counter.

A claim that would **cross** the cap is refused with `CONFLICT` (exit 4) and the
run flips to `waiting-human` with a reason of the shape
`budget: spend N of cap M reached at <instance>`. A claim that lands *exactly* on
the cap is allowed: a budget reached is spent, not exceeded.

Omitting `--budget` takes `docket config budget.default`, resolved **at
`run start`** and stored on the run. A default set afterwards does not re-cap a
run already started — the same pinning property a workflow version has.
`docket run report` prints the effective cap and where it came from, so "why
didn't it stop?" is answered by a read verb.

**A breached run is un-wedged with `docket run budget RUN-N --set N`** (DKT-29).
`run resume` alone clears nothing — the cap has not moved, so the next claim
breaches again — which is why raising the cap and resuming are two commands:

```bash
docket run budget RUN-3 --set 50 --reason "estimate was low"
docket run resume RUN-3
```

#### `docket run issue add|remove RUN-N DKT-N...` — `run_issue.go`

Edits a run's issue set after `run start`. Both take a run and **one or more**
issues, and take no flags beyond the global ones.

```bash
docket run issue add RUN-3 DKT-11 DKT-12 --json
docket run issue remove RUN-3 DKT-12 --json
```

| Verb | Legal while the run is… | Refused when… |
|---|---|---|
| `add` | `planning` **or** `active` | the run is parked or terminal — `CONFLICT` (exit 4) |
| `remove` | `planning` only | the run has been activated at all — `CONFLICT` (exit 4) |

**`add` on an ACTIVE run is legal**, and the new issues are bound and
snapshotted by the **next** `docket run activate` (RA3) — they join as their
dependencies allow, exactly as a later phase does. The success message says so.
A parked run is a person's decision in progress and a terminal run's issue set
is history, so neither admits an add.

**`remove` stops at activation** because an activated issue is bound,
snapshotted, and possibly scheduled: removing it would strand steps that already
exist. Abandon the run instead if its shape is wrong.

**The whole set is validated before anything is written.** `add` checks every
issue exists first, so a typo'd second ID cannot leave a half-applied add
behind; `remove` checks every issue is actually attached first, so
`remove DKT-1 TYPO` cannot detach `DKT-1` and then refuse. An issue that does
not exist, or is not attached to this run, is `NOT_FOUND` (exit 2); a missing
run is `NOT_FOUND`; a malformed ID is `VALIDATION_ERROR` (exit 3).

Both answer with the set **after** the change — `{run, status, issues}` — so a
caller sees what the run now holds rather than re-deriving it from what it
asked for.

#### `docket run report RUN-N` — `run_report.go`

Takes no flags beyond the global ones. **READ-ONLY**: it computes effective
status and writes nothing — not even the lease reap `next` performs — so polling
it cannot advance a run. It works on a run in **any** status: `planning` reports
zeros, `abandoned` reports the trail up to abandonment.

| Section | Contents |
|---|---|
| `run` | id, status, reason, request, wall clock (activation → now, or → the terminal transition) |
| `budget` | effective `cap` and its `cap_source` (`run` \| `config` \| `unlimited`), the `floor`, `reported` per unit, the `budget_unit` the cap counts, `spend` = max(reported, floor), `burn_rate` (floor per wall-clock hour), and `breach_reason` when a budget paused the run |
| `steps` | count by **effective** status, plus per-step `attempts` |
| `gates` | per-gate pass/fail/unmatched counts, and the per-step trail |
| `actions` | the same rollup over action results, `builtin` included |
| `artifacts` | the **index**: id, kind, producer instance, producer `executor` and `issue`, sha256, bytes — never the bodies |
| `metadata` | step `metadata` keys → distinct values with counts, verbatim and uninterpreted — over the **merged** bag, so both what a definition declared and what a worker reported via `step complete --metadata` are counted |
| `actors` | per-actor event counts (`next` / `gate` / `threshold` / `human`) — the attribution rollup described under `docket events` below, computed over the events that remain |
| `vote_metadata` | the same key → distinct-value rollup over vote seats' `--metadata` bags |
| `vote_usage` | per-unit sums of vote seats' `--usage` reports (DKT-95), beside the step ledger's `reported` — never merged with it |

**Trail and index rows are attributable.** A gate or action trail row is
`{step, step_id, issue, name, ordinal, verdict, reason?, output?}` — the
instance label alone was not enough, because instance names **collide across
issues in one run** (two issues on the same workflow both have an
`implement@0`), so a trail keyed on the label was unattributable. Join on
`step_id`; read `issue` to tell the two apart.

`output` rides on **non-pass rows only**, as the last 2000 bytes of the capture
prefixed with `…` when it was longer. A passing check's chatter is noise every
reader pays for, while a failing gate's diagnosis otherwise meant re-running it
out-of-band — most expensive exactly where a false failure blocks a security
path. The full capture stays on the result row itself; the report's job is
diagnosis, not archival.

The artifact index carries the producer's `executor` and `issue` for the same
reason. `producer` alone is a fanout ordinal (`review@0#2`), which says *where*
in the topology an artifact came from and nothing about *who* — and the opaque
executor hint is the axis a question about judge behavior actually groups by.
Both are omitted when the row has none.

**The budget numbers are bare.** There is no currency and no unit: what they
count is the workflow's business. The report publishes the numbers a warn policy
needs — cap, floor, reported-per-unit, burn rate — so an instance computes its
own warn threshold from a read verb. Core ships the cap and no warn.

**Reported usage is summed per unit and never across units.** Two units are two
numbers; docket has no opinion about whether they add up. Only the unit
`budget.unit` names participates in the cap comparison; the rest are recorded and
reported.

The document is **deterministic** given the same rows — every section orders by a
total key — apart from the wall clock and the burn rate derived from it, which
measure elapsed time.

#### `docket run activate RUN-N` — `run_activate.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--pin` | — | stringSlice | `nil` | file to pin by content hash (repeatable) |
| `--dry-run` | — | bool | `false` | compute the activation, print what it would bind and invoke, **write nothing** |
| `--reason` | — | string | `""` | why; recorded on the `run-activated` event |

One transaction, all or nothing:

0. **Auto-register** the contents of `.docket/config/` (see below).
1. **Bind** each issue to **exactly one** registered workflow by its `[match]`
   clause (`kind`, `labels_any`, `labels_all`, `unless_labels`, the last
   evaluated last and winning). Matching considers only the **highest
   registered version of each name**, the same version `workflow show NAME`
   resolves to, so exactly-one-match applies across *names*: bumping a
   workflow's version never makes the next activation ambiguous. Zero matches
   or several is `VALIDATION_ERROR` naming the issue **and** every candidate
   (the bindable ones — superseded versions are never listed).
2. **Lint** the work graph for dependency cycles.
3. **Pin** each bound workflow at its registered `source_sha256`, plus every
   `--pin` file at its own. Pinning is never partial: one unreadable path
   refuses the whole activation and writes nothing.
4. **Snapshot** each issue's body, title, kind, labels, and scope. Steps read
   the snapshot, never the live issue.
5. **Harvest** fenced command blocks whose tag a bound workflow's gates declare
   as `source = "fence:<tag>"`, verbatim and hashed. Blocks with an undeclared
   tag are **not** harvested.
6. **Expand** the first phase's steps — those whose issues have no unsatisfied
   `depends_on`. Later phases expand as their predecessors complete.
7. **Promote** the issues `backlog → todo`, and the run to `active`.

**Nothing executes.** No gate, no action, and no command runs during
activation; files are read only to hash them.

**Auto-registration — you never run a register verb.** Activation registers the
current contents of `.docket/config/`, so a definition goes from "written" to
"registered" by starting a run:

| Directory | What activation does |
|---|---|
| `config/schemas/*.json` | **registers** as a payload schema, named for the file (`findings@1.json` → `findings@1`) |
| `config/workflows/*.toml` | **registers** as a workflow definition, named by its own `[pipeline]` block |
| everything else under `config/` | **pins** by content hash and registers nothing — contracts, fragments, templates, `policy.toml` |

**Schemas register in full before workflows**, so a workflow naming a schema in
the same tree always registers second and its `payload` reference resolves.
Within each group the order is lexical, for determinism. Registry directories are
scanned flat; the pinned ones are scanned recursively. A file whose extension
does not match — a `README.md` in `workflows/` — is skipped in the registry and
pinned like any other file, so documentation never blocks a run.

Registration reuses the ordinary register path: same validation, same
immutability. **Changed bytes at an unchanged `name@version` is `CONFLICT`
(exit 4) and refuses the whole activation**, naming the file, both hashes, and
the literal edit to make:

```
.docket/config/workflows/standard-dev.toml has changed since it was
registered as standard-dev@1.

  registered  sha256:3f9a…   current  sha256:c41b…

A registered name@version is frozen so that a run which pinned it can
reproduce. To adopt these changes, bump the definition's version to 2,
then activate again. Runs already pinned to standard-dev@1 are unaffected.
```

Docket never auto-bumps a version, never overwrites a registered one, and never
silently uses the old bytes. Identical bytes re-register freely and change
nothing.

**A re-activation does not re-scan.** It inherits its pin set, so a config file
edited while a run is under way is invisible to that run and cannot trigger the
refusal above on a run that was working fine.

**A repo with no `.docket/config/` is untouched by any of this**: the directory
is checked once, and an absent one skips the scan entirely.

**The registration report.** Activation prints one line per registered file —
`name@version  path  (new | unchanged)`, schemas first — followed by a count of
what it pinned. Under `--json` the same data rides in a `registered` array of
`{kind, name, version, path, sha256, outcome}`. An activation that registered
nothing prints no block and carries no `registered` key.

**The trust report.** After the transaction commits, activation prints every
harvested fenced command verbatim, annotated `matched` (naming the trust entry)
or `unmatched` (with the reason) — so you see which commands a run will
actually invoke *before* it runs, not after. Under `--json` the same data rides
in a `fences` array of `{issue, gate, tag, ordinal, command, matched, entry,
reason}`.

It is a **report, not a gate**: activation succeeds with unmatched commands.
They simply will not run, and their gates route per `on_fail` when reached —
refusing would let anyone who can file an issue block a run by adding an
untrusted line.

Commands print with control characters escaped (see security.md §8.2); the
`--json` form carries the raw bytes. `--dry-run` prints the same report and
discards the whole transaction, so you can inspect what a run would bind
without committing to it.

**The scope lint.** Activation warns about every issue that declared **no
scope at all** while binding a workflow that holds the tree — such an issue's
holding step occupies the tree without excluding, or being excluded by, any
other issue, so the scheduler can offer it beside work it collides with. The
warnings ride in `scope_warnings` under `--json` (a `{issue, workflow, reason}`
array, `omitempty`, so a fully-scoped run carries no key — `issue` is the
display id, e.g. `"DKT-87"`, never the internal numeric PK) and print on
**stderr** in human mode, naming the remedy —
`docket issue edit DKT-N --scope GLOB`, since scope is set on the *issue*, not
in the workflow named beside it.

It is a warning, never a refusal. A **declared-but-empty** scope does not warn:
that is a decision somebody made on purpose, and warning about it is how a
warning becomes noise. The lint reads the **live** issue rather than the
snapshot, so an operator who sets a scope after a first activation has fixed
the omission by the next one. "Holds the tree" means `holds_tree` and nothing
else — never a class name, which core attaches no meaning to.

**The routing lint (DKT-33).** A second warning, in the same `scope_warnings`
array, fires per issue whose declared scope resolves **nothing** under the
run's recorded exec root — the signature of an issue planned into the wrong
repository, which otherwise surfaces only after a full wave (an executor
booted into a worktree that cannot contain the fix, a gap filed, the review
fanout dispatched over the empty result). The test is **anchored existence,
not file existence**: each entry's literal prefix (up to the first glob
metacharacter) must exist under the root, or its parent directory must; one
anchored entry clears the issue. A scope may name files the work will CREATE,
so the lint deliberately under-reports rather than flagging greenfield
new-file scopes. A run with no recorded exec root skips it entirely. The
message names the root it resolved against and the way out —
`docket issue move --project`, or fix the scope.

Re-activating an `active` run expands newly-unblocked phases only and
**inherits** the original pin set — a workflow re-registered or a pinned file
edited since activation does not reach a run already under way. Its success line
says so: `(re-activation: original pin set inherited, nothing re-registered)`,
because counts alone read as fresh binding-and-pinning work, which is exactly
how a no-op against a stale picture gets mistaken for a real activation.

Refusals: unbindable issue / work-graph cycle / run with no issues / context
over `context.error_bytes` → `VALIDATION_ERROR` (3); missing run or `--pin`
path → `NOT_FOUND` (2); terminal run, `waiting-human` run, or open dispatch →
`CONFLICT` (4).

Two of those `CONFLICT`s say more than that they happened:

- A **terminal** run's refusal carries the run's **recorded reason** — an
  operator whose picture of the run is stale learns from one message not only
  that the run ended but why, instead of going to read the row.
- A **`waiting-human`** run is refused with `resume it with docket run resume
  RUN-N before re-activating`. Flipping it back to `active` here would take a
  person's decision as a side effect, and worse: only `active` runs count as
  re-activations, so this path would treat it as a *first* activation and
  re-scan config.

#### `docket run pause|resume|abandon RUN-N` — `run_lifecycle.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--reason` | — | string | `""` | required on `abandon` (with or without `--issue`) |
| `--issue` | — | string | `""` | (`abandon` only) abandon only this issue's remaining steps; the run and its other issues continue |

`pause` moves `active → waiting-human`; `resume` moves it back; `abandon` is
terminal from any non-terminal status. A paused run blocks new claims and
honors in-flight completes.

**`abandon --issue` is the per-issue disposition (DKT-28)** — for a mis-routed
or unimplementable issue that should not take the whole run down with it.
Every remaining (non-terminal) step of that issue moves to `failed-routed` —
the same terminus the `abandon-issue` routing produces — an `issue-abandoned`
event records `{issue, reason, steps}` (the stopped instances), and the
ordinary reconciliation rollup runs in the **same transaction**, so the run
continues, returns from a park, or completes if this was its last unfinished
work. The issue's **own status is not forced terminal** — triage stays the
operator's. Refusals: run not `active` or `waiting-human` → `CONFLICT`
(exit 4); issue not part of the run → `NOT_FOUND` (exit 2); every step already
terminal → `CONFLICT` (nothing to abandon); missing `--reason` →
`VALIDATION_ERROR` (exit 3).

An **illegal transition is refused** with `CONFLICT` (exit 4) rather than
silently applied — pausing an already-paused run must not report success, or a
harness believes it quiesced a run that never was active. `abandon` without
`--reason` is `VALIDATION_ERROR` (exit 3).

**Each of the three writes its event in the same transaction as the status** —
`run-paused`, `run-resumed`, `run-abandoned`, with `data` carrying
`{from, to, reason}`. `from` is there because the interesting question about a
transition is what it left; `reason` because "abandoned" alone does not answer
what somebody will ask about a run that ended without completing. Before this,
abandonment wrote no event at all and a consumer reading only the feed saw a
paused run as the final state, unable to learn that the run had ended, when, or
why. There is no `run-done` here: no operator verb moves a run to `done` —
that is the reconciliation rollup's transition, and it logs itself.

#### `docket run budget RUN-N [--set N]` — `run_budget.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--set` | — | float | — | set the cap to this number; `0` means unlimited |
| `--reason` | — | string | `""` | why the cap is changing (recorded in the event) |
| `--if-version` | — | int | — | apply only at this `row_version`; `CONFLICT` (4) otherwise |

Without `--set` this **reads**: the cap, where it came from (`run` \| `config` \|
`unlimited`), the `floor`, the `reported` usage in the unit `budget.unit` names,
and the `spend` = `max(reported, floor)` that is actually enforced. Those are the
numbers an operator needs to choose a new cap, so choosing one does not require
reading a report first.

`--set` **raises or lowers** a live cap. Raising is the way out of a budget
breach:

```bash
docket run budget RUN-3                    # what stopped it, and at what
docket run budget RUN-3 --set 50 --reason "estimate was low"
docket run resume RUN-3                    # a separate, deliberate act
```

**It does not change the run's status.** A breached run is `waiting-human` and
stays so until `run resume` — `waiting-human` means a person decides when work
restarts, and a verb that un-parked as a side effect would take that decision
back. Nothing re-scans and nothing sweeps: the claim path reads the cap fresh
from the row, so the next claim after a resume simply proceeds.

Lowering below what a run has already spent takes effect the same way — the next
claim refuses. **Raising a cap cannot un-spend what was spent:** the floor is
computed from the run's claim events, so it does not move when the cap does. A
new cap below the existing floor refuses the very next claim.

**A cap change that resolves the breach clears the breach record.** When the run
carries a `breach_reason` and the new cap is unlimited (`0`) or at least the
current `spend`, `breach_reason` is cleared; if that breach is also what parked
the run, the run's `reason` is **rewritten** to name the cap change —
`budget: cap changed from N to M after breach (was: …); run resume to continue`.
The row states what is true *now*. Without this the stale
`budget: spend N of cap M reached at <instance>` survived a raise and read as a
still-walled run to anyone checking (see also `run report`'s `breach_reason`).

The change is **event-logged** as `run-budget-set` carrying `from` and `to`, so a
run whose cap moved has a trail saying so, and the clearing rides in **that same
event** as `breach_cleared` (the retired reason string) — so an auditor reads
"the cap moved *and* the breach record was retired" as one fact instead of
inferring the second from the row's silence. `row_version` is bumped whether or
not `--if-version` was passed. Refused on a terminal run (`CONFLICT`, exit 4): a
finished run's cap is a record of what it was allowed to spend, and that does not
move.

Clearing the record still does not change the run's **status** — a breached run
stays `waiting-human` until `run resume`, which remains a separate, deliberate
act.

#### `docket run status [RUN-N]` — `run_status.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--active` | — | bool | `false` | list only non-terminal runs (list form) |
| `--limit` | — | int | `50` | list form; `0` means no limit |

With an ID: the run, its issue count, its steps grouped by status, and its
pins. Without: a `Collection` of runs — under `--json=v2` the payload is
`{items, total, truncated}` with each item carrying `row_version`.

**Read-only.** This verb computes effective status and writes nothing.
`--active` keeps `planning` runs: a run that exists but has not been activated
is still live work. Passing `--active` with an ID is `VALIDATION_ERROR`, since
it filters a list.

None of the `run` verbs are watch-eligible.

### `docket dispatch` — `dispatch.go`

A **dispatch** is a frozen copy of one `next --run` answer, recorded so a batch
dispatcher's spawns can be checked against what the engine actually offered.

It is **not a lock and not a claim.** The steps in a manifest are still
`pending`, and any claimant may still claim them — a dispatcher is the thing
that *starts* workers, not a worker, so claiming on its behalf would mint a
token nobody holds. What a manifest buys is that the engine can refuse to offer
a *new* batch while the previous one is unreconciled, which turns a relay that
lost track of its own spawns from a silent double-executor into a stalled run
with a reason.

| Verb | Writes | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `dispatch open --run RUN-N` | yes | computes the offer exactly as `next --run` does and records it |
| `dispatch verify --run RUN-N` | **no** | recomputes and compares to the manifest, byte for byte |
| `dispatch close --run RUN-N` | yes | reconciles and closes — refused while a discrepancy exists |
| `dispatch abandon --run RUN-N` | yes | gives up on the manifest **unconditionally** |
| `dispatch backfill-usage --run RUN-N` | yes | records usage a relay measured but the claimant could not report |

`--run` is required on all five. None are watch-eligible.

#### `docket dispatch open`

| Flag | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--run` | string | — | **required** |
| `--limit` | int | `0` | maximum manifest rows; 0 is no limit. Slices *after* ordering, so a limited manifest holds the highest-priority steps |
| `--ack-reap` | int64Slice | `nil` | acknowledge a write-class reap by its `lease-reaped` event `seq`; repeatable |

Response is engine-spec §11.4's `dispatch` shape: `{dispatch, run, opened_seq,
expires_ms, rows: [<next row>…]}`. Each row is stored as its canonical JSON
bytes plus a sha256, so `verify` compares bytes rather than a re-serialization
that could differ in key order.

`open` performs the same lazy lease reap `next` does — offering a stale step
that a reap would have freed would make the manifest wrong the moment it was
written.

**Exactly one dispatch is open per run**, enforced by a partial unique index
rather than a check-then-insert: two relays racing produce one manifest and one
`CONFLICT`, never two manifests. The loser's computation is discarded, not
merged — a merge would produce a manifest neither relay saw.

#### `docket dispatch verify`

**This verb writes nothing, including no lease reap.** It is the one
scheduling-shaped verb that must not reap: reaping would change the very ready
set it was asked to compare against, and a verify that mutated its own subject
could never fail.

Equal is exit 0 with `{verified: true}`. Unequal is `CONFLICT` naming the
**first differing position**, with the stored row and the recomputed row both
rendered — so an operator can see whether a lease lapsed, a priority changed, or
a step completed, rather than being told the two differ.

`stage` and `conditional` are **normalized before the comparison**: both are
set-relative, and both legitimately move as an in-offer predecessor records or
routes, so a row whose stage collapsed or whose conditional mark cleared is
not a discrepancy.

#### `docket dispatch close`

| Flag | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--run` | string | — | **required** |
| `--accept-missing-usage` | bool | `false` | close despite `usage-rows-missing`, recording the acceptance |

Refuses `CONFLICT` while any discrepancy exists, enumerating each with its
resolution (the table under `docket next` above). `--accept-missing-usage`
accepts **only** that class: `claimed-but-unrecorded` has its own resolution —
lease expiry — and a flag that accepted both would let a relay close over work
that is still running.

The acceptance is *recorded*, not merely permitted: `close_reason` becomes
`accepted-missing-usage` and the accepted step list rides in the
`dispatch-closed` event's `data`.

**Acceptance closes the dispatch; it does not clear the discrepancy.** The
`usage-rows-missing` probe is computed from `steps.usage_recorded` and never
reads `close_reason`, so a later `next` recomputes the same refusal from the
same column — and each subsequent close re-accepts the whole set. To make the
discrepancy go away, record the usage: `docket dispatch backfill-usage`.

#### `docket dispatch backfill-usage`

| Flag | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--run` | string | — | **required** |
| `--step` | string (repeatable) | — | step whose usage is being recorded |
| `--unit` | string (repeatable) | — | unit for the matching `--step`; core has no default unit |
| `--quantity` | float (repeatable) | — | quantity for the matching `--step` and `--unit` |
| `--from-json` | string | `""` | JSON array of `{"step","unit","quantity"}`; `-` reads stdin |
| `--source` | string | `"backfilled"` | who measured it; recorded on every row |

engine-core §7's back-fill: a relay that measured its own spawns carries those
numbers into the ledger, with the source recorded. Usage otherwise rides only
on `step complete --usage`, which a claimant that cannot observe its own
consumption has no way to supply.

Two forms, one per invocation — `--step/--unit/--quantity` pair positionally
(the Nth of each is one row), or `--from-json` for a whole batch. Passing both
is refused: one batch, one source of truth.

**The whole batch is one transaction.** A back-fill that half-applied would
leave a dispatch neither closable nor honestly re-runnable.

Rows land on the step's **recorded attempt**, and there is deliberately no flag
to name a different one — back-filling an arbitrary historical attempt is
rewriting history. The ledger's `(step, attempt, unit)` key means a retried
step's second attempt records *beside* its first, and a repeat of the same
triple is refused `CONFLICT` rather than merged.

`--source` is free text and is always written explicitly, so a relay's
reconstruction stays distinguishable from a claimant's own `reported` rows.
Core enumerates no sources, for the same reason it enumerates no units.

#### `docket dispatch abandon`

| Flag | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--run` | string | — | **required** |
| `--reason` | string | `""` | why; recorded in the `dispatch-abandoned` event |

**Unconditional, and that is the point.** This is the crashed-relay path: the
relay is gone and cannot resolve anything, so a recovery verb that refused to
recover while a discrepancy existed would be the mechanism by which a crashed
relay wedges a run.

Nothing is lost. Opening a manifest never claimed anything, so its steps return
to the ready set intact, and an executor that claimed one *before* the crash
finishes normally.

#### The write-reap acknowledgment

Reaping a lease in a class with a finite `[limits] max` **holds that class's
headroom** until somebody acknowledges the reap. The database lease is not a
tree fence: nothing about an expired lease stops a still-running process from
writing, so a successor must not start beside a writer that may still be alive.

Core cannot check a process it did not start, so it refuses to pretend
otherwise and asks for the one fact it cannot observe. The acknowledgment
**never requires the dead relay** — a new session, which may be a person typing,
confirms the tree is quiet and passes `--ack-reap <seq>`.

- The reaped step itself is re-offered; other steps in its class are not.
- Classes with **no** `[limits] max` get neither ack rows nor a hold. A repo
  with no `[limits]` never sees this mechanism at all.
- Acking a seq that is not a reap, or not this run's, is `VALIDATION_ERROR`.
  Acking the same seq twice is a success that changes nothing.
- `acked_by` records the **verb** (`dispatch-open`), never a user identity —
  core has no identity model.

`docket guard spawn --ack-reap` is the other entry point and lands with the
guard verbs.

### `docket events` — `events.go`

The engine's event log, as a cursor feed. Every transition an engine verb makes
writes an event in the same transaction that performs it, so the log is the run's
own account of itself rather than a summary written afterwards.

#### `docket events list`

| Flag | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--since` | int64 | `0` | return events with `seq` **strictly greater** than this cursor |
| `--run` | string | `""` | filter to one run; omit for the project-wide feed |
| `--all-projects` | bool | `false` | show every project's events instead of the current project's; store-level events (trust grants) show either way |
| `--tail` | int | `0` | return the newest N events, still **oldest-first** — the mid-incident read, since reaching the end of a long feed by cursor means paging through all of it. Mutually exclusive with `--since` |
| `--limit` | int | `100` | maximum events returned, applied **after** ordering |
| `--follow` | bool | `false` | poll for new events and print them as they arrive; Ctrl-C to stop |

`--follow` uses the **global** `--interval` (default `2s`, minimum `500ms`) — the
same flag `--watch` uses, so the poll period has one definition across every verb
that polls. An interval below the floor is `VALIDATION_ERROR` (exit 3).

Each event is:

```
{ seq, at_ms, kind, run?, step?, step_id?, issue?, data }
```

`seq` is a monotonic counter that is **never reused**, including after a delete.
`run` is `RUN-N` and `step` is the rendered instance identity (`name@k#i`); both
are omitted when the event has none — a trust grant belongs to no run. `step_id`
is `STEP-N`, so a consumer can follow the feed straight into `step show`.
`data` is the transition's own payload, carried **verbatim**: core never reshapes
it, and never reads a key inside it.

`issue` is `DKT-N`, omitted when the event has none. **Filter on it, never on
the instance label**: instance labels collide across issues in one run — two
issues bound to the same workflow both have a `fix@1` — and a feed filtered by
label once misattributed a pass-route to a reaped step over exactly that
collision. The column was always stored; the wire now carries it.

**The cursor contract.** `--since` is strictly greater, so you store the last
`seq` you saw and pass it back without re-reading that event. The read is one
query in one transaction over a monotonic counter, so an event written *while*
you are reading lands above your cursor and arrives on the next call. **No event
is ever skipped and none is ever returned twice.** Ordering is always oldest
first; there is no reverse mode, because a cursor feed that could run backwards
is a cursor feed that skips.

A cursor past the end returns an empty page, not an error — a consumer that has
caught up must be able to keep polling. A cursor *below the retained minimum* is
`GONE` (exit 9) rather than a silently short answer, and the message names the
`seq` to resume from. `docket events prune` is what puts a cursor there.

Without `--run` the feed is project-wide, which is the only place events
belonging to no run — trust grants — are visible; `--all-projects` widens it
to every project in the store.

**`--follow` polls.** There is no daemon and no subscription: the flag runs the
same query on a ticker, printing only what is new each cycle, and the process is
idle in between. The cursor advances to the last `seq` actually returned, so an
event written *while* a cycle was reading arrives on the next one — the same
no-skip-no-repeat property the one-shot form has, extended across cycles.

Output is append-only: the screen is never cleared and no page is reprinted, so
a follow can be piped, grepped, and read afterwards. Ctrl-C ends it and exits 0
— interrupting a follow is how a follow ends.

A follow whose cursor falls below the retained minimum — someone pruned under it
— **stops** with `GONE` rather than resuming at the new minimum. Resuming would
hand the consumer a feed with a hole in it and no indication there was one.

#### `docket events prune`

| Flag | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--before` | int64 | `0` | delete events with `seq` **strictly less** than this |
| `--before-run` | string | `""` | delete every event of this run (`RUN-N`) |
| `--run` | string | `""` | narrow `--before` to one run |
| `--dry-run` | bool | `false` | report what would be deleted and delete nothing |
| `--yes` | bool | `false` | confirm the deletion; **required** unless `--dry-run` |

Exactly one of `--before` / `--before-run` is required: a destructive verb with a
default target is how a log gets deleted by a typo.

**It refuses more than it accepts.** Two refusals, and neither is negotiable:

- **Events of runs that have not reached `done` or `abandoned`** are never
  deleted (`CONFLICT`, exit 4, naming the runs). A live run's events are what the
  engine *computes from* — its budget floor is summed from its `step-claimed`
  events, and its saga resumes from its `gate-started` events — so pruning them
  would change the run rather than only its record.
- **Events younger than `docket config events.retain`** are held back. That
  window defaults to `0`, which retains **everything**: prune deletes nothing at
  all until an operator states a retention policy. When the window holds rows
  back, the answer says how many, rather than returning a smaller number with no
  explanation.

Events belonging to no run — trust grants — are prunable by `--before`, since
there is no run whose liveness could forbid it.

**It deletes rows in `events` and nothing else.** No artifact, no step, no run,
no usage row, no dispatch row. It does not `VACUUM`: reclaiming file space is a
decision made against a backup, not a side effect of trimming a log.

The prune **records itself** as an `events-pruned` event whose `seq` is above
everything it removed — so the record of the deletion survives the deletion, and
a consumer that hits `GONE` and resumes at the new minimum reads the explanation
for its own gap as the first thing it sees.

The answer is `{pruned, retained_minimum, held_by_retention?, dry_run?}`. The
retained minimum is there so a consumer can reset its cursor without a second
call — the call that invalidated the cursor is this one.

Pruning costs the audit trail `docket run report` computes over: a trimmed run
reports fewer transitions than it actually made. Trim whole runs that have
finished rather than the oldest N events across all of them, and the report stays
honest for every run it still covers.

Human mode renders one line per event and escapes stored strings on the way to
the terminal; `--json` carries the raw bytes, because the consumer there is a
program. Under `--json=v2` the result is the usual `{items, total, truncated}`
collection, where `total` counts matching events **before** the limit sliced
them.

**It writes nothing.** Reading the log cannot advance a run.

#### Attribution — who caused each transition

Every event kind maps to exactly one of four actors, and `docket run report`
publishes the per-actor counts:

| Actor | Meaning | Kinds |
|---|---|---|
| `next` | the scheduler | `step-ready`, `lease-reaped`, `join-completed`, `loop-entered`, `dispatch-abandoned`, `issue-promoted` |
| `gate` | a deterministic check, actions included | `gate-started`, `gate-recorded`, `gate-unmatched`, `gate-rerun`, `vote-opened`, `vote-tallied` |
| `threshold` | computed routing | `step-routed`, `step-failed`, `step-superseded`, `step-skipped`, `step-held` |
| `human` | an operator verb, including one a harness relays | `run-*` (`run-started`, `run-activated`, `run-paused`, `run-resumed`, `run-abandoned`, `run-done`, `run-budget-set`), `step-claimed`, `step-heartbeat`, `step-recorded`, `step-resolved`, `step-approved`, `step-rejected`, `step-annotated`, `issue-abandoned`, `trust-*`, `dispatch-opened`, `dispatch-closed`, `reap-acknowledged`, `events-pruned` |

The three operator lifecycle kinds each carry `data` of `{from, to, reason}`,
written in the same transaction as the status they record. `lease-reaped` is
attributed to `next` whether the lease expired or `docket step reap` forced it;
`data.forced` plus the operator's `reason` is what separates the two.

Four rows are worth their sentence. **`run-done` is `human`** even though no
operator verb moves a run to `done`: the reconciliation rollup writes it, but
the rollup runs inside whatever operator-actor verb completed the run's last
work, and the table maps kinds, not code paths.
**`step-claimed` is `human`, not `next`**:
the scheduler *offers*, and something else *takes* — calling the claim a
scheduling decision would hide exactly the boundary this table exists to expose.
**`run-paused` is `human` even when a budget breach causes it**, because the
transition means "a person must now decide"; `data.reason` distinguishes a
budget breach from an operator's `run pause`. **`events-pruned` is `human`**
because nothing in the engine prunes — there is no sweep, no compaction, and no
automatic retention — so the event exists only because somebody ran the verb.

Note what the last row implies about the audit itself: attribution is computed
over the events that *remain*, so a pruned run reports fewer transitions than it
made. `events-pruned` is what keeps that honest — a trimmed log says it was
trimmed rather than looking like a quieter run.

### `docket step` — `step.go`

Steps are the units of work a run schedules. A step is **claimed** — which
mints a capability token and returns the whole context bundle in one response —
then **completed** with an artifact.

| Verb | Token | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `step claim STEP-N [--render] [--template F]` | no | CAS claim; mints token; returns token + context (or packet) |
| `step heartbeat STEP-N` | **yes** | extends the lease; does not touch `attempt` |
| `step reap STEP-N --reason R` | no | forced reap of a dead holder's claim, without waiting out the lease |
| `step complete STEP-N --artifact-file F …` | **yes** (stages 0–1) | the saga |
| `step fail STEP-N [--note …] [--metadata …]` | **yes** | routes per `on_fail` when the CLAIM count reaches `max_attempts` (E-8: attempt counts claims, never failures) |
| `step annotate STEP-N --metadata JSON` | no | merges opaque KV onto a **finished** step's record; event-logged |
| `step approve\|reject STEP-N [--note …] [--value V]` | no | `type="human"` gate steps, and a materialized held step of either kind (a vote-minted one once a failed tally parks it) |
| `step resolve STEP-N --as …` | no | `waiting-human` resolutions; `retry` **resets attempts** |
| `step show STEP-N` | no | read-only; effective status |
| `step list --run RUN-N` | no | read-only; every step of one run — id, instance, issue, kind, effective status, attempt, expected_cost — in (issue, creation) order. The budget-projection enumeration (DKT-54): step ids are a store-wide sequence, so id arithmetic cannot enumerate a run. Watch-eligible. |
| `step context STEP-N [--meta]` | no | re-emits `context` read-only |
| `step render STEP-N [--template F]` | no | context bundle → rendered work packet |
| `step artifacts STEP-N` | no | read-only; lists what the step PRODUCED, sizes not bodies |
| `step artifact ARTIFACT-N [--payload]` | no | read-only; one artifact in full |

#### `docket step artifacts` / `docket step artifact`

**How an action step's verdict is read.** An action's result and an
aggregate's held-cluster payload both live in the `artifacts` table, and
neither had a CLI surface before: `step show` renders the row, `step context`
renders a step's **inputs**, and the run report's artifact index gives sizes
and hashes but never a body. Reading a verdict meant opening
`.docket/issues.db` with `sqlite3` by hand.

`step artifacts STEP-N` lists — reference, kind, size, payload size, hash — and
deliberately carries **no bodies**, since an artifact runs to 1MiB. A step that
produced nothing lists nothing and exits 0; a step that does not exist is
`NOT_FOUND`, so a typo never reads as "this step produced nothing".

`step artifact ARTIFACT-N` fetches one in full. `--payload` narrows to the
structured half and, under `--json`, emits it as **parsed JSON rather than a
string**, so `jq` reaches the verdict's own keys directly:

```
docket step artifact ARTIFACT-3 --payload --json=v2 | jq -r '.data[0].severity'
```

Both take the `ARTIFACT-N` form the listing and the run report's index print; a
bare `N` is accepted too. Both are **read-only and write nothing** — no reap,
no lease touch.

#### `docket step claim`

| Flag | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--owner` | string | — | **required**; identifies the lease holder |
| `--ttl` | duration | `0` | defaults to the step's configured TTL |
| `--render` | bool | `false` | return the rendered packet instead of the bundle |
| `--template` | string | `""` | template file for `--render` |
| `--executor` | string | `""` | resolved executor hint for `--render`'s `{executor}` packet substitution (default: the step's declared hint) |

The response is engine-spec §11.4's `claim response` verbatim:
`{ step, token, lease_expires_ms, context }`. The token is returned **exactly
once** — capture it or claim again. In human mode it prints on its own line and
never inside the status message.

Claim enforces readiness **itself** rather than trusting that you ran `next`; a
step that is not ready is `CONFLICT` naming the unmet condition. **Human, vote,
and action steps are not claimable** — the first two are gates rather than work,
and an action step is the engine's own computation — and a claim against one is
`CONFLICT` naming its class and what advances it instead.

#### `docket step reap`

| Flag | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--reason` | string | `""` | **required**; why the holder is being declared dead |

**Token-free**, like `approve` and `resolve`: the authority is repository access
plus the recorded assertion that the holder is gone. Liveness is otherwise
TTL-only, and a TTL cannot be sized right in both directions — raised to cover
healthy long writers, it multiplies how long a dead agent's claim blocks its row.
The engine cannot probe a process it did not start, but the relay that spawned
the executor can, and this verb is the channel for what it observed.

**Every consequence is the expiry reap's own**: the same `lease-reaped` event
(carrying `data.forced` and the reason, which is how a reader tells the two
apart), the same write-class headroom hold awaiting `--ack-reap`, the same return
of the step to the ready pool.

`--reason` is required, and omitting it is a `VALIDATION_ERROR` (exit 3) — a
forced reap asserts the holder is gone, and somebody will ask on whose word.
Only a `claimed` or `running` step holds a lease to reap; anything else is
`CONFLICT` (exit 4) naming the step's actual status, and a missing step is
`NOT_FOUND` (exit 2).

**Reaping a holder that is in fact alive carries exactly the risks a lease
expiry does** — the database lease was never a tree fence. Assert liveness, do
not assume it.

This verb is also the way to clear a dead holder on a run that is **not
active**, where neither the lease TTL nor `max_step_duration` reaps at all (see
`[limits]` above). `step reap` checks the step's own status, not the run's.

#### `docket step complete`

| Flag | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `--artifact-file` | string | **required**; the artifact body. Capped at **1 MiB**; over it is `VALIDATION_ERROR` naming the size and the cap |
| `--payload-file` | string | JSON array of objects. When the step declares `payload = "name@version"`, it is validated against that schema — the bytes the run PINNED, not the registry's current ones — and a failure is a `VALIDATION_ERROR` (exit 3) naming the element and property (`payload[3].severity: …`), up to five lines and then `(+N more)`. Omitting it on a step that declares `payload` is the same refusal: a declared payload is a contract, and recording none would make every threshold over it evaluate against the empty set. A step that declares no `payload` is shape-checked only, exactly as before. |
| `--gap-file` | string, **repeatable** | one out-of-scope problem the work surfaced. Each records an auxiliary artifact of kind `gap` beside the step's declared emit **and** materializes a backlog issue related (`relates_to`) to the step's own — same transaction, so the residue cannot evaporate. Capped at **1 MiB** each, like any artifact; an **empty** gap is `VALIDATION_ERROR` (exit 3). Gap files are read whole before the saga starts, so a bad path refuses without spending the completion |
| `--usage` | string | `{"unit": n, …}` — a JSON object of **opaque** unit names to numbers, recorded in the run's usage ledger and summed per unit by `run report`. At most **32** units; each name at most **64** printable-ASCII bytes with no whitespace; each number finite and **≥ 0**. Any other shape is `VALIDATION_ERROR` (exit 3) naming the offending key. Docket never interprets, converts, or routes on these numbers — the one named by `docket config budget.unit`, if any, participates in the run's cap comparison, and that is the whole contract |
| `--metadata` | string | a JSON **object** of opaque keys to values, **merged onto the step's own** metadata: keys the definition declared survive, keys only the worker reports are added, and a key in both takes the worker's value. The merge is **shallow** — a nested object is a value, replaced wholesale, never descended into. Capped at **16 KiB** measured on the supplied bytes; over it is `VALIDATION_ERROR` naming the size, the cap, and the two channels for bulk detail (`--artifact-file`, `--payload-file`). Anything that is not a JSON object — an array, a scalar, `null` — is `VALIDATION_ERROR`. Docket never reads a key inside: the merged bag is delivered verbatim in the context bundle and rolled up key → distinct value → count by `run report` |
| `--worktree` | string | the checkout the work happened in; the recorded `issue.diff` is computed **there** rather than in the invoking checkout (the default). The declared path lands in the diff's round record beside the head sha, which is where a consumer's `target_worktree` comes from |

Completion is a **saga**: validate → record the artifact → gates one by one →
routing. **The token retires when the artifact records.** From that commit the
step is engine-owned and finishes under any later invocation, so a worker that
dies mid-saga strands nothing. Completing twice is `AUTH_ERROR`, not a duplicate
artifact.

**Gaps need no workflow declaration — the channel is always open.** A worker
that surfaces a problem outside its own scope has nowhere to put it: narrating
it into the artifact body buries it in prose, and dropping it loses it entirely.
`--gap-file` gives it two durable homes at once, in the completion's own
transaction. The materialized issue is created `backlog` / `none` / `task`, with
the gap body as its description and its title taken from the gap's first
non-blank line (leading `#` stripped, capped at 120 characters). Docket never
interprets what the gap says. The success message names the issues it filed —
`Completed, gaps filed as DKT-91, DKT-92: …`. The materialized issue lands in
the RUN'S OWN project unconditionally — `--gap-file` has no cross-project
routing — so a gap whose problem lives in another repository's project gets
re-homed by whoever reads the completion: `docket issue move <id> --project
<target>` (operator ruling, 2026-08-16: gaps belong to their respective
projects).

**A gap-only completion PARKS instead of passing (DKT-25).** When the declared
emit's body is empty (whitespace-trimmed) and at least one gap was recorded,
the step routes `waiting-human` **before the gate verdict or threshold is
consulted** — the worker's whole answer was "this work cannot be done here,
and here is the residue", and routing `pass` over it would schedule the
issue's entire downstream pipeline over an empty change (a full judge fanout
independently verifying "nothing to judge" was the measured cost).
`step resolve` is the operator's disposition. Gaps recorded **beside real
content** route exactly as before. When the gap belongs to a different
repository, `docket issue move --project` re-homes the filed issue.

#### `docket step fail`

| Flag | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `--note` | string | why the step failed — lands on the **failure EVENT**, prose for a human reading the run's history |
| `--metadata` | string | a JSON **object** of opaque keys to values, merged onto the step's own — lands on the **STEP ROW**, structured KV for a query. `--note` and `--metadata` are complementary, not alternatives, and both are accepted on the same invocation |

`--metadata` is DKT-69's parity with `step complete --metadata`: the same
shallow, last-write-wins merge, the same shared write path
(`internal/engine`'s `mergeMetadata` and `db.SetStepMetadataTx`), and the same
16 KiB cap — measured and refused pre-transaction, so a rejected `--metadata`
spends no attempt. The refusal message differs from `complete`'s: `step fail`
offers no `--artifact-file` or `--payload-file`, so it points at `--note`
instead of channels this verb does not have.

**It SURVIVES INTO A RETRY.** A failed attempt's bag merges into the step's
row like any other, so the next attempt's completion (or failure) overlays on
top of it — a worker that reports *why* it failed has produced the most
valuable metadata in the run, and discarding it at retry would lose exactly
the diagnostic an operator wants. It reaches `run report --json`'s existing
metadata rollup the same way a completion's does — no new rollup, no new
report section, and it is reachable **even for a step that never completes**,
which is the run an operator most wants tier-drift data from.

#### `docket step annotate`

| Flag | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `--metadata` | string | **required**; a JSON **object** of opaque keys to values, merged onto the finished step's own metadata |

The post-completion channel for facts that become true only **after** a step's
record freezes (DKT-35). The canonical case is integration: a relay that
rebases or cherry-picks a recorded commit mints a NEW sha, and every run
record citing the writer's own — change-summary first lines, issue comments,
the round record — is unreachable from any ref once the worktree is swept.
Annotating the step with the durable id keeps the run record re-checkable.

The merge is the **same rule `step complete --metadata` uses** — shallow,
last-write-wins, 16 KiB cap on the supplied bytes, non-object refused — and it
is **token-free**: the lease retired with the artifact, and this is an
operator-side act about the record, not a completion. The merge is logged as a
`step-annotated` event carrying the annotation **verbatim**, so what was added
survives a later annotation overwriting the same key.

Refusals: a step that has not reached a terminal status is `CONFLICT` (exit 4)
naming its actual status — a live step's metadata lands with its record, under
its holder's token, and a side channel into an in-flight record would bypass
exactly that authorization. Empty or non-object `--metadata` is
`VALIDATION_ERROR` (exit 3); a missing step is `NOT_FOUND` (exit 2).

#### `docket step resolve`

| Flag | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `--as` | string | **required**: `retry` \| `skip` \| `abandon-issue` \| `override-pass` |
| `--note` | string | why |

`retry` resets the **step's** attempt budget. That is a different counter from
the issue-level attempt trail, which is monotonic and never reset. `resolve` is
also how an operator moves a run past a `type="vote"` step whose voters have not
cast — a run must not be hostage to a quorum that never arrives.

**`retry` is refused on a step parked by a rejected held cluster** —
`VALIDATION_ERROR` (exit 3), naming the held step — rather than silently
re-parking it. Re-running the aggregate re-reads the same rejected decision and
routes to the same place, so the attempt counter was never what blocked it. The
refusal names the three resolutions that can move it: `override-pass`, `skip`,
`abandon-issue`.

**`retry` is refused on a held cluster parked by a vote that did not pass**, for
the same reason: the idempotency key is `(run, instance)`, so the next `next`
re-reads the *same* finished tally and parks it again. That refusal names
`step approve` / `step reject`, which is the better remedy anyway — the question
is open and the operator can simply answer it. The other three resolutions do
apply to such a step, and `override-pass` there records the cluster as resolved
exactly as `approve` would, so the payload never says "undecided" about a
cluster the routing already passed.

#### `docket step approve|reject`

| Flag | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--note` | string | `""` | why the gate was approved or rejected |
| `--value` | string | `""` | (`approve` only) corrected value for a **held cluster's** aggregated field |

Both are **token-free**: a gate is resolved by an operator who never claimed it.
They apply to `type="human"` steps, and to a **materialized** `<step>-held` step
whichever kind it was minted as — anything else is `VALIDATION_ERROR` naming the
step's actual class, because reaching for `approve` usually means mistaking
which step is blocking.

The held step is where an `aggregate` step's held clusters are decided. The
difference from a declared gate is where the consequence lands: approving a
declared gate finishes that gate, while approving a held cluster un-defers the
aggregate step's routing (see *Held clusters* above). Deciding one twice is
`CONFLICT` (exit 4) naming both steps.

When holds are minted as votes (`vote.hold.*`), these verbs apply to a held step
**once a vote that did not pass has parked it** at `waiting-human`. Before that
the tally owns the decision and both verbs are `VALIDATION_ERROR`, naming
`step resolve` as what moves a run past a vote still being cast — approving
during a tally would take the panel's turn away and orphan its open proposal.

`--value` belongs to that second case only. It sets the cluster's aggregated
field to a value validated against the **pinned schema's declared enum**,
recording the computed value it replaced as `operator_set_from`, and `--note`
travels with it as `operator_note` — the full rules are in *Held clusters* above.
On a declared human gate, or alongside `reject`, it is a `VALIDATION_ERROR`.

#### `docket step context` / `render`

`context` re-emits the bundle read-only, no token. It is assembled from the
run's **pinned and snapshotted** state only — the issue as it read at
activation, the recorded input artifacts, and the pin list. It never reads the
live issue, never reads the working tree, and never opens a pinned file, so two
calls at the same run state are byte-identical whatever has been edited between
them. `--meta` adds per-section byte counts as a **sibling** object, leaving the
bundle itself unchanged.

`render` formats that bundle through a template. Without `--template` the
shipped default is used; it ships in the binary and cannot drift. With
`--template F`, **if the run pinned that path the file's bytes are verified
against the pin** and a mismatch is `CONFLICT` naming both hashes — never a
warning, never a silent re-pin. An unpinned template renders unverified and says
so. `--executor` (also on `step claim --render`) overrides the resolved hint
used for `packet` entries' `{executor}` substitution; the default is the
step's own declared hint.

**Read verbs here write nothing**, including no reap — even for a step whose
lease has lapsed, which reads as `pending` while the row still carries the stale
owner.

### `docket guard` — `guard.go`

Deterministic predicates over engine state, for hooks.

| Verb | Allows when |
|---|---|
| `guard stop` | no pending work outside `waiting-human` |
| `guard gate --step NAME` | a **passed** `type="human"` **or** `type="vote"` step of that name exists for an active run — an approval on the one, a tallied approval on the other. Both kinds answer, so converting a gate to a vote does not silently stop the hooks that check it; a vote still being cast reads as undecided and denies |
| `guard record [--run RUN-N]` | no unreconciled dispatch exists — no open manifest, and no discrepancy |
| `guard spawn --run RUN-N` | the proposed rows byte-match the open dispatch **and** no write-class reap is unacknowledged |

**Exit 0 = allow, exit 2 = deny with a reason.** That contract is independent of
the error-code table above: a guard's caller tests a boolean, so exit 2 here
means "denied", not "not found". The reason goes to stderr in human mode and
into the envelope's `error` under `--json`.

**When the resolved store has no database, a guard ALLOWS (exit 0) rather than
denying.** A repo with no engine has no engine state to forbid anything, so
"not applicable" is an allow. The reason still travels — `not_applicable: true`
plus a `reason` in the JSON payload, and a `guard: …` note on stderr in human
mode — so a surprisingly-permissive hook is still diagnosable.

This is the one place the exit-2 collision had to be broken. Previously a
missing database took NOT_FOUND's exit 2, which a hook wired as
`docket guard stop || exit` could not tell from a denial, so every non-docket
repo on the machine started denying. Only the absence of a database allows this
way; every verdict a guard actually computes still denies through exit 2.

`guard stop` deliberately does **not** block on `waiting-human`: it asks whether
the machine is done working, and a run waiting on a person is not something a
stop interferes with.

Guards answer over the **current project's** runs by default. `guard stop`,
`guard gate`, and `guard record` accept `--all-projects` to answer over every
project's runs in the store instead — the same vocabulary as
`events list --all-projects`. (`guard spawn` is inherently per-run and has no
such flag.)

#### `guard record` — before a worker records

| Flag | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--run` | string | `""` | the run to check; **omit** to check every non-terminal run |

Wire it before letting a worker call `step complete`. An unreconciled batch means
the engine's picture of what is running is already wrong, and recording an
artifact into that picture is how drift becomes durable.

"Unreconciled" is the **same two probes `next` uses** — an open dispatch, or any
discrepancy — computed by the same function, so the guard and the scheduler
cannot disagree. The denial repeats `next`'s refusal verbatim, resolutions
included.

Without `--run` it answers over every non-terminal run and denies if any is
unreconciled, matching `guard stop`'s shape, so a hook wired once keeps working
as runs come and go. A `--run` naming a run that does not exist is `NOT_FOUND`
(exit 2), not a vacuous allow: a typo must not read as permission.

#### `guard spawn` — before a relay starts a batch

| Flag | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--run` | string | `""` | **required** — the run whose batch is being spawned |
| `--rows` | string | `""` | file holding the JSON array of rows about to be spawned (`-` for stdin) |
| `--ack-reap` | int64Slice | `nil` | acknowledge a write-class reap by its `lease-reaped` event `seq` (repeatable) |

Both halves must hold. With **no** open dispatch and **no** `--rows`, the row
half is vacuously satisfied and the reap half still answers — so a relay that
batches its own way still gets the check. With `--rows` and no open dispatch it
is a **denial**: the relay believes it is spawning a batch the engine never
issued. A row that does not byte-match shows **both sides' bytes**, so you can
see what moved rather than being told they differ.

`--ack-reap` is processed **before** the predicate, so one command both
acknowledges and answers — which is what lets a relay's spawn hook be a single
invocation. It is also the second of the two entry points for the
acknowledgment; `dispatch open --ack-reap` is the other, for a **new** relay
taking over from a crashed one. Acknowledging asserts *you* have established the
old writer is gone: the engine knows its database lease lapsed and cannot check a
process it did not start.

Acking a seq twice is a success that changes nothing. Acking a seq that names no
reap of this run is `VALIDATION_ERROR` (exit 3) — an acknowledgment must name a
real reap.

**Both guards write nothing, except that acknowledgment.** Neither reaps and
neither auto-abandons an expired dispatch, so a hook's mere presence cannot
change how a run schedules.

**The guard is an early check, not a lock.** Between its allow and the actual
spawn, a dispatch can be abandoned or a lease reaped; the real enforcement stays
where it has always been, in `step claim`'s compare-and-swap.

### `docket trust` — `trust.go`

The allowlist of commands docket may execute. **A gate runs only when an entry
here authorizes it**; an unmatched gate is reported, never run. Full details and
the reasoning are in docs/spec/security.md §7.

Entries live in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/docket/trust.toml` (default
`~/.config/docket/trust.toml`), owned by you, mode `0600`, and **never read
from a repository**. There is no `--trust-file` flag, no env override beyond
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, and no config key — every extra way to point docket at a
trust file is another way for repo content to choose it.

**A missing trust file is not an error.** It is an empty allowlist: every gate
reports `unmatched`, nothing runs, and the run tells you what it needed. That
is the answer to "I just installed this and nothing executes" — nothing is
supposed to, yet.

These verbs need no `.docket/` database: the store is user-level.

#### `docket trust add <name> -- <argv...>` 

| Flag | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--global` | bool | `false` | trust in **every** repository, not just this one |
| `--prefix` | bool | `false` | match any command *beginning* with this argv; prints an over-authorization warning |
| `--re-runnable` | bool | `false` | safe to run again after a crash interrupted it |
| `--tree` | bool | `false` | touches the working tree; serializes against other such gates |
| `--flaky` | bool | `false` | may fail intermittently; re-runs on failure, each attempt recorded |
| `--network` | stringSlice | `nil` | hosts this command must reach (repeatable). **Declares a requirement; grants nothing.** A gate that names any receives the proxy variables and `DOCKET_GATE_NETWORK`; one that names none is unchanged |
| `--timeout` | duration | `5m` | per-command timeout |
| `--yes` | bool | `false` | skip the interactive confirmation (the argv is **still** disclosed) |

**Everything after `--` is the argv, verbatim.** Your shell already tokenized
it and docket stores those tokens — nothing is split, expanded, or globbed, and
no shell is ever involved in running it. A flag after `--` belongs to the
trusted command:

```bash
docket trust add tests -- make test
docket trust add lint  -- golangci-lint run --fix   # trusts ["golangci-lint","run","--fix"]
```

The entry binds to the **current repository** unless `--global`. A command
trusted in one project does not execute in a clone of another; moving a
repository invalidates its entries (`trust list --all` shows the stale binding
so you can see why a gate went `unmatched`).

`--yes` suppresses the prompt, **never the disclosure**: the argv, the binding,
and the `--prefix` warning print on every add and ride in the JSON response.

| Situation | Result |
|---|---|
| new name+repo | insert, exit 0 |
| identical argv and flags at an existing name+repo | idempotent success, nothing written, exit 0 |
| **different** argv or flags at an existing name+repo | `CONFLICT` (exit 4) naming both argvs; `trust rm` first |
| unsafe store (symlink, wrong mode, wrong owner, writable parent) | `VALIDATION_ERROR` (exit 3) naming the path and the fix |
| no argv after `--` | `VALIDATION_ERROR` (exit 3) |
| the grant cannot be recorded in this repo's event log | `GENERAL_ERROR` (exit 1); the store is **untouched** |

#### `docket trust list`

| Flag | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `--global` | bool | only global entries |
| `--all` | bool | every repository's entries, not just this one's |

A `Collection`, so `--json=v2` renders `{items, total, truncated}`. Argvs print
with control characters escaped.

#### `docket trust rm <name>`

| Flag | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `--global` | bool | remove the global entry rather than this repo's |

`NOT_FOUND` (exit 2) when no such entry is bound here.

#### The trust audit trail

`add` and `rm` write a `trust-added` / `trust-removed` event, carrying the argv
**hash** rather than the argv — so a grant made mid-run is auditable without
leaking the command's arguments into a feed a run report renders. Beside the
hash the event carries every property that affects behavior: `name`, `repo`,
`global`, `prefix`, `re_runnable`, `tree`, `flaky`, `network`, and `timeout`.
Those are what a grant **widens**, and a feed showing only the name could not
tell a re-approval from an escalation.

**Recording is mandatory inside a repository, not best-effort.** The event is
written *before* the store, as a hook inside the store's own lock: if it cannot
be recorded, the verb fails with `GENERAL_ERROR` (exit 1) and **nothing is
granted**. An absent event is not a neutral outcome — an auditor reads it as
"no grant happened" — so the only divergence that can survive is a recorded
change that then failed to land, which is loud rather than silent and errs
toward over-reporting authority.

**An idempotent re-add emits no event.** Nothing was written, so there is
nothing to record: a record of a change must prove a change happened.

**Outside a repository the verbs still work, and say what they did not do.**
The store is user-level, so requiring a database to manage it would mean
somebody who installed docket could not approve a command until they created a
tracker. When the repository cannot be resolved, or there is simply no database
at the resolved path, the change is applied and a **warning** says it was not
recorded and that nothing will show it later. The warning prints on stderr and
rides in the JSON response's `warnings` array; like the argv disclosure, it is
not suppressible.

| `--summary` | — | string | `""` | one-line summary |
| `--metadata` | — | string | `""` | JSON object, 16 KiB cap measured on the **encoded** bag (whitespace does not count, escaping does); the seat's own opaque claim about what cast the vote — worked example above; stored whole, never read by core, never verified. It is visible in the process list, stored verbatim in the store, and re-emitted verbatim by `docket export`, so put nothing secret in it |
| `--usage` | — | string | `""` | `{"unit": n, ...}` — this seat's own spend report (DKT-95), recorded per seat in the `vote_usage` ledger inside the cast's transaction and summed per unit in the run report's `vote_usage` section. Same rules as `step complete --usage`: at most 32 units, finite non-negative numbers, opaque unit names. Exists because a vote step is never claimed (attempt stays 0), so the step ledger's key cannot hold per-seat rows |

| `--description` | `-d` | string | `""` | `"@path"` loads a file, `"-"` reads stdin (1 MiB cap each) |
| `--type` | `-T` | string | `""` | free-form (no enum validation) |
| `--status` | `-s` | string | `""` | free-form (no enum validation) |

#### `docket doc edit <id>` — `doc_edit.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--title` | `-t` | string | `""` | only applied when explicitly set |
| `--description` | `-d` | string | `""` | same `@path`/`-` semantics as create |

|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--type` | `-T` | stringSlice | `nil` | repeatable |
| `--status` | `-s` | stringSlice | `nil` | repeatable |

Watch-eligible.

#### `docket doc delete <id>` — `doc_delete.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--cascade` | — | bool | `false` | also removes issue/proposal links (not the linked issues/proposals) |
| `--force` | `-f` | bool | `false` | **required in `--json` mode and non-interactive human mode** (DKT-27: an output-format flag is never consent); in interactive human mode it skips the confirmation prompt |

#### `docket doc link add/remove` — `doc_link.go`

| Command | Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `add <id> --issue <issue_id>` | `--issue` | — | string | `""` | **Req.** |
| `remove <id> --issue <issue_id>` | `--issue` | — | string | `""` | **Req.** |

| `--idempotency-key` | — | string | `""` | (`add` only) replay protection |

`comment list` has no local flags; watch-eligible.

### `docket export` — `export.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--format` | `-o` | string | `"json"` | `json`\|`csv`\|`markdown` |
| `--file` | `-f` | string | `""` | output path; empty means stdout |

### `docket import <file>` — `import.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--merge` | — | bool | `false` | skip duplicates by ID; mutually exclusive with `--replace` |
| `--replace` | — | bool | `false` | destructive: clears DB first; mutually exclusive with `--merge` |
| `--yes` | — | bool | `false` | confirm `--replace`; **required** in every output mode (DKT-15) |

### `docket board` — `board.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--label` | `-l` | stringSlice | `nil` | repeatable |
| `--priority` | `-p` | stringSlice | `nil` | repeatable |
| `--assignee` | `-a` | string | `""` | |
| `--expand` | — | bool | `false` | show sub-issues individually instead of rolling up into parent |

Watch-eligible.

### `docket stats` — `stats.go`

No local flags. Watch-eligible.

### `docket init` — `init.go`

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--local` | — | bool | `false` | create a repo-local `.docket` store in the cwd instead of initializing the resolved (by default shared `~/.docket`) store |

`Annotations: {"skipDB": "true"}` — runs before any DB check/open, since its
job is to create the DB. Initializing an existing database is an idempotent
success (`created: false`) that also applies pending migrations. `--local`
opts out of the shared store; resolution prefers an existing local store over
the global one, so subsequent commands find it without any flag.

### `docket project` — `project.go`

The shared store's tenancy surface. A store used to BE a project, so there was
nothing to list; under `~/.docket` every repository is a row, and these verbs
are the operator's view of that dimension. Neither is watch-eligible.

#### `docket project list`

No local flags. Lists the store's projects — `{id, name, prefix, identity,
current}` — with the **current** invocation's project marked (`*` in human
mode). A project's `identity` is the canonical path (or git identity) that
claims it; `(unclaimed)` renders when none has. A `Collection` under
`--json=v2`. This is where `issue move --project` targets come from.

#### `docket project set-prefix PREFIX`

Sets the prefix this project's issue ids render and parse with. The prefix is
**display only**: the number is the identity, global across the store, so
`VOR-42` and `DKT-42` name the same issue. `DKT-` always parses whatever the
prefix, and a bare number always works — references in old commit messages
and other projects' run records never go stale. 1–8 letters (upcased); `DOC`,
`RUN`, and `STEP` are reserved for their own entities (`VALIDATION_ERROR`).
The rest of the invocation renders in the new voice immediately.

### `docket version` — `version.go`

No local flags. `skipDB` annotated.

### `docket config` — `config.go`

No local flags. `skipDB` annotated (reads config even if no DB exists yet,
to report that fact). Watch-eligible.

#### `docket config set <key> <value>` / `docket config get [key]` — `config_set.go`

Engine defaults, stored in the `meta` table. **Not** `skipDB` — unlike the bare
verb these need the database. `get` with no key lists every value with its
source (`set` or `default`); under `--json=v2` the listing is a standard
`{items,total,truncated}` collection. Unknown keys and ill-typed values are
`VALIDATION_ERROR` (exit 3) at `set` time. Both take `--global`: `set --global`
writes the store-wide default rather than this project's override, and
`get --global` reads the store-wide layer ignoring project overrides. See the
Engine configuration section above for the key table, defaults, and the
project/store layering.

## Enum Reference

Transcribed from `internal/model/issue.go`, `relation.go`, `proposal.go`
(validated by `model.Validate*` helpers called from the corresponding
`RunE`):

| Enum | Values |
|---|---|
| Issue status | `backlog`, `todo`, `in-progress`, `review`, `done` |
| Issue priority | `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical` |
| Issue type/kind | `task`, `bug`, `feature`, `epic`, `chore` |
| Relation type | `blocks`, `depends_on`, `relates_to`, `duplicates` |
| Proposal criticality | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical` |
| Proposal status | `open`, `approved`, `rejected`, `committed` |
| Vote verdict | `approve`, `approve-with-concerns`, `reject` |

`docket doc`'s `--type`/`-T` and `--status`/`-s` are **free-form strings**
with no enum validation in the CLI layer — pick a project convention (e.g.
`tdd`, `adr`, `ux`) and use it consistently.

## ID Formats

| Entity | Prefix | Example | Parse accepts |
|---|---|---|---|
| Issue | `DKT-` (per-project display; see below) | `DKT-42` | `DKT-42`, `dkt-42`, or bare `42` |
| Document | `DOC-` | `DOC-7` | `DOC-7`, `doc-7`, or bare `7` |
| Proposal (vote) | `DKT-V` (no separator before digits) | `DKT-V3` | `DKT-V3`, `dkt-v3`, or bare `3` |
| Run | `RUN-` | `RUN-3` | `RUN-3`, `run-3`, or bare `3` |
| Step | `STEP-` | `STEP-12` | `STEP-12`, `step-12`, or bare `12` |

The issue prefix is per-project (`docket project set-prefix`) and display
only: in a project whose prefix is `VOR`, issues render `VOR-42`, but the
number is the store-wide identity — `DKT-42`, `VOR-42`, and bare `42` all
parse to the same issue. `DOC`, `RUN`, and `STEP` are reserved and never
project-configurable.

A step also carries a rendered **instance identity** — `name@k#i`, where `k` is
the loop ordinal and `#i` the fanout sibling index (`implement@0`,
`review@0#2`). That is the step's public name in wire shapes, events, and error
strings; `STEP-N` is its database id. Both appear on every step row.
