# 06 — Docket vNext: a generic workflow engine for issues

Status: approved — 2026-08-02 · final boundary (third pass) set after Erik clarified the
criterion: features belong **in** Docket exactly when they are valuable and reusable for
*anyone* tracking multi-step work — human teams or agent fleets, any domain — and stay
out when they encode his fleet's specifics. Ratification: README / 01 §6.

The result: Docket core grows a **domain-neutral workflow engine** — workflows, steps,
runs, claims, gates, typed payloads, events, usage ledger — and the public story stays
coherent with the README's existing identity ("issue tracking for ai and humans").
Everything fleet-specific remains outside as configuration and harness data.

**The genericity rule (binding on every feature below):** core Docket contains zero
agent/LLM vocabulary — no node, model, prompt, brief, severity, or review concepts.
Executors are opaque string hints; execution metadata is an opaque KV bag; ordered
meaning comes from user-registered schemas; computations beyond scheduling arithmetic
are user-trusted commands. The stranger test for every verb: *a team that has never run
an LLM should find it useful as documented.*

What stays **outside** core (Erik's instance): the prose (node contracts, fragments,
skills), the workflow/policy instances and payload schemas (machine-authored per T9,
§2 "Instance config lifecycle"), and one harness adapter (wave.js) plus one-line hook
shims. Former glue is absorbed as generic verbs: brief.sh → `step render`,
reconcile.py → the builtin `aggregate` action, hook logic → the `guard` family.
`engine.py`/`.graph/` from the second boundary pass are dissolved: semantics land here,
in Go, in `.docket/issues.db`.

docket step     show|context
docket artifact show ART-N | list --run RUN-N
docket events   --follow [--since SEQ] ; docket events prune --before …
```

Existing verbs (`issue`, `plan`, `board`, `vote`, `doc`, `export`, …) keep exactly one
meaning each; workflow features are additive verbs and dormant tables — a repo that
never registers a workflow observes no change anywhere.

## 2. Semantics per verb group

All semantics are 02's, restated here only where the generic surface differs:

**Workflows.** Registered TOML in the generic grammar (05 §1): `[match]` predicates
over kind/labels; steps with `executor` (opaque hint), `after`, `inputs`, `fanout`,
`gates`, `threshold`, `on_fail` routing (closed vocabulary), loops with specified
re-expansion rules (step identity per loop entry, threshold re-application, gate
re-runs — the DSL's loop semantics are part of this spec, not implementation
discretion), `max_attempts`, `expected_cost`, `metadata` passthrough. Validation runs at register time (the grammar itself, plus threshold fields against
registered schemas) and at activation time (bindings resolvable, pins recorded).

**Activation.** Fat transaction as 02 §3: DAG lints; workflow binding; version pinning —
registered objects by version, **plus arbitrary operator-supplied file pins** (path +
content hash), which is how Erik pins node contracts, fragments, and policy without core
knowing what they are; issue-body snapshots (incl. fenced command blocks, §4); lazy
phase expansion; promotion via the issue verbs. Re-activation lints and expands new
phases only, inherits the original pin set, and is refused while a dispatch is open.

**Steps, claims, capabilities.** As 02 §5 and the ratified soundness set: `claim` is
CAS-atomic, mints a random capability token (delivered via env/stdin, never argv), and
returns the **context bundle** — step row, issue snapshot, declared input artifacts,
pinned-file list with hashes — in the same response; `--render` returns the assembled
prompt instead (§ Rendering). `complete`/`fail`/`heartbeat` refuse non-holders
(AUTH_ERROR) and stale leases (STALE_LEASE). `complete` is the specified saga —
artifact+payload validation → gates one-by-one → routing — with panel-hardened
semantics: **the token retires when the artifact records**; from that commit the saga
is engine-owned and resumes lazily under any later engine invocation, each stage its
own transaction, no subprocess ever inside a transaction, every stage commit
refreshing the step's activity clock. Gates are **at-least-once**: a `gate-started`
event precedes each spawn; on resume, a started-but-unrecorded gate re-runs only if
its trust entry is flagged re-runnable, else the step parks `waiting-human`. Routing
is one transaction spanning step, issue mirror, run, and events. `waiting-human`
steps resolve via `step resolve` (retry = attempts reset · skip · abandon-issue ·
override-pass, note recorded); `approve|reject` belongs to `type=human` gate steps
only, and a human gate's reject routing may not itself be `waiting-human`
(register-time VALIDATION_ERROR).

**Scheduling.** `next` computes readiness (02 §5): dependencies, predecessors, scope
non-overlap, run active, concurrency headroom per executor-hint class (a generic knob;
Erik's config sets his write class to 1 — serialization is *instance policy*, not core
behavior), budget headroom. Ordering: priority then age. `dispatch open/close/verify`
give batch dispatchers (the wave) a manifest to verify against byte-for-byte and make
"unreconciled batch" an engine-refusal state — with recovery designed in: exactly one
dispatch open per run (CAS/unique index), a dispatch TTL lazily auto-abandoned by
`next` (event-logged), explicit `dispatch abandon` for a crashed relay, and enumerated
discrepancy resolutions (lease expiry clears claimed-but-unrecorded;
`dispatch close --accept-missing-usage` records the acceptance). Reaping a
**write-class** lease additionally holds write headroom until the relay acknowledges
the `reaped` event (surfaced by `guard spawn`) — the DB fence is not a tree fence; a
wedged writer must be confirmed gone before a successor writes.

**Fanout joins.** A fanned-out step joins when every sibling is terminal
(`done | skipped | superseded | failed-routed`); a sibling in `waiting-human` parks
the issue. Downstream `inputs` resolve over `done` siblings only, ordered by (declared
position, sibling index, artifact id). `on_fail` applies per sibling; `min_siblings` (§11.1) permits quorum joins: the join
still waits for all siblings to reach a terminal state (no early cancel in v1), and if
`done` count < `min_siblings` at join, the fanned step routes per its `on_fail`.

**Rendering.** `docket step render` (or `claim --render`) formats the context bundle
into a rendered *work packet* (text) through a template — a shipped generic default,
or a pinned instance template file. Packet *layout* is thereby core mechanics while
*content* stays instance data; no harness needs a formatting script. (This design's
harness hands the packet to an LLM as its prompt; core neither knows nor cares.)

**Guards.** `docket guard spawn|record|stop|commit` are deterministic allow/deny
predicates over engine state for harness enforcement points (exit 0 allow / exit 2
deny with reason): `spawn` — proposed rows byte-match the open dispatch and no
unacknowledged write reaps; `record` — no unreconciled dispatch; `stop` — no pending
work outside `waiting-human`; `gate --step NAME` — an approved `type=human` step of that name exists for the active
run (Erik's commit hook shims `guard gate --step commit-gate`). Any harness's hook
mechanism wires these as one-liners; the logic lives here. (`step heartbeat` serves
the heartbeat hook — an engine verb, though not a guard predicate.)

**Payloads and thresholds.** `schema register` accepts JSON Schema plus an
`ordered_enum` annotation; thresholds in workflow defs are then generic comparisons
(`threshold = { "fix-loop" = "any(severity >= high)" }` works because *the user's
schema* declared the order — core never knows what a severity is). Aggregations beyond comparison are **action steps**. One is builtin and generic:
`action = "aggregate"` with `params = { field, method = median|max|min, hold_spread,
output }` computes over any ordered-enum payload field — median, spread-hold, and a
recorded demotion trail work for severities, priorities, or tiers alike. Cluster membership arrives in the
payload itself: each element is one cluster, whose `field` value is either a scalar
(a one-member cluster — the identity case) or an array of the cluster's member
values *(amended 2026-08-03, DKT-23)*. When `hold_spread` trips, the engine materializes a `type=human` step named
`<step>-held` gating the routing step, and the aggregate's output payload —
per-cluster value, members, held flag, `demoted_from`, `operator_resolved` — validates
against the shipped `aggregate@1` schema. Erik's reconciliation is therefore
parameters, not code. Other computations remain user-trusted commands receiving step
context on stdin.

**Budgets.** Enforced against `max(reported, floor)`; floor = Σ claimed steps'
`expected_cost` (from the workflow def) — engine-owned facts, so the cap holds with
reporting absent. Reported usage (opaque numbers on `complete`) only raises the
counter; missing usage rows are a dispatch discrepancy.

**Runs, report, events.** As 02 §3/§1.6: ledger rollup (usage, attempts, gate trail,
artifact index, metadata rollups), NDJSON event feed with `--follow`, prune verb.
Read verbs render *effective* status (lease expiry computed at read time, no write) —
status never lies just because nobody called `next`.

**Instance config lifecycle (T9 — zero-touch).** Instance files live in the repo at
`.docket/config/` (`workflows/`, `schemas/`, `contracts/`, `fragments/`,
`templates/`, `policy.toml`) — git-versioned like any code. They are
**machine-authored**: a bootstrap agent drafts them at project start (mining the
build system, test commands, git history, conventions), the retro pipeline evolves
them from run evidence, and the human only approves in conversation. **Activation
auto-registers** the config directory's current contents (content-hash versioning) —
registration is never a manual step, and schemas are stable reviewed files, never
generated per-run. Strangers start from shipped optional templates
(`docket workflow init --template standard-dev`) — a working baseline with zero
authoring. At plan approval the session surfaces what activation will bind — including every
harvested fenced command, verbatim — so what the human approves is what was actually
read, not a summary. Developer responsibility, by design: provide work, approve at
gates — nothing else.

## 3. Storage

Schema v5 on `.docket/issues.db`: additive tables (runs, steps, artifacts,
gate_results, events, pins, dispatches, trust-cache) + `version` CAS columns on
existing entities (part of §5). Dormant unless workflows are used; existing verbs'
behavior is byte-compatible (`--json=v2` opt-in aside). Artifacts capped at 1MiB with
explicit refusal; events carry monotonic `seq`; lifecycle specified: `events prune`,
artifact GC per run-retention config, documented backup (`sqlite3 .backup`), WAL-on-
synced-directory warning in docs. `docket migrate` is idempotent, backup-first,
additive-only; v4 DBs open unchanged. `events prune` refuses events of non-terminal
runs and never crosses the artifact-retention boundary; `events --follow --since`
below the retained minimum returns GONE rather than silently skipping.

## 4. Execution trust model (gates, actions, fenced commands)

Docket executes registered commands at workflow transitions — the one place it runs
anything — under a trust model fit for an OSS tool:

- **User-level trust only, repo-scoped by default.** Executable argv templates live
  in `~/.config/docket/trust.toml` (per-user, never repo-shipped), managed by
  `docket trust`; each entry binds to the repo it was approved in unless `--global`
  is explicitly chosen — an argv trusted for one project does not execute in a
  malicious clone of another. Workflow defs and issues reference names only. A cloned
  repo can never introduce execution; unknown names require an explicit one-time
  `trust add` (TOFU, argv-hash recorded).
- **Fenced command blocks** (generic form of Erik's ```ac``` convention): a workflow
  gate may declare `source = "fence:<tag>"`; commands are harvested from the issue
  body **at activation** (snapshotted, hashed — post-activation edits cannot inject)
  and each must match a trust entry — a full-argv hash satisfies the match; prefix
  entries are the explicit opt-in case — or it is *not executed* and reported as
  unmatched. Any team using executable acceptance checks gets this; no team gets
  drive-by execution.
- Mechanics: resolved argv, no shell interpolation, cwd repo root, env allowlist,
  timeout with process-group kill, captured output with explicit truncation,
  flaky-declared re-runs recorded individually. Read verbs never execute. Gates are
  at-least-once and **must be idempotent**; `re-runnable` is a per-entry trust flag
  (§2). Gates that touch the working tree declare `tree = true` and serialize on an
  engine-held per-repo mutex — parallel read-step completions never race a build.
- Trust entries default to **full-argv hashes**; prefix entries are explicit opt-in
  (`trust add --prefix`, with an over-authorization warning). Tokens pass via
  env/stdin, never argv; claim markers are 0600 in a per-user runtime dir.
- **Conversational trust (zero-touch posture):** in this solution the session
  proposes, the human approves in-chat, and the session runs `trust add --yes` — the
  harness's own command-permission prompt is the human-confirmation backstop. The
  residual risk (a misbehaving session self-trusting a command) is accepted and
  bounded by full-argv hashing plus the permission layer (08 D14).

## 5. Docket core reliability delta (stage 1; unchanged from prior spec)

CAS `--if-version` everywhere + versions in `.data`; uniform envelopes
(`{items,total,truncated}`) behind `--json=v2`; explicit truncation flags; hard
VALIDATION_ERROR on silent-drop cases (fires under `--json=v2` only; v1/human output
stays byte-identical per §9 item 8); idempotency keys on create verbs; millisecond
timestamps + `seq`; error taxonomy extended once for all new verbs (NOT_FOUND,
VALIDATION_ERROR, CONFLICT, AUTH_ERROR, STALE_LEASE, TIMEOUT, UNTRUSTED). Generic,
valuable standalone, and deletes nine wrapper scripts in the current fleet.

## 6. Concurrency model

As 02 §9 in Go: WAL, busy_timeout, single-transaction mutations, CAS claims, lazy lease
reaping confined to `next`/`claim` (reads never write; read verbs compute *effective*
status from `expires_at`). No subprocess ever executes inside a transaction — each
saga stage commits separately (§2). Multiple dispatchers are safe
and pointless. Erik's writer-serialization is his concurrency config (§2), enforced by
`next` like any other headroom rule.

## 7. Out of scope (hard boundaries)

No daemon; no network; no model calls; no prompt/agent vocabulary anywhere in core
(the genericity rule — a PR introducing `model`, `prompt`, or `llm` into core surface
fails review by definition; metadata KV exists precisely so such things ride through
opaquely); no execution outside §4; no cross-repo federation in v1 (08 D6); no VCS coupling beyond the declared
`issue.diff` provider (git in v1, §11.1); board/UI
growth limited to opt-in run/step columns.

## 8. Erik's instance configuration (examples, not core defaults)

The routing/budget table formerly in this section is unchanged in substance but is now
explicitly *instance data* living in his repo: `policy.toml` (executor-hint → metadata
{model, effort}, delivered to the wave as step `metadata` on `next` rows — the
workflow script reads no files; `never`-style constraints enforced by his workflow
thresholds over recorded metadata plus the spawn-guard hook),
`expected_cost` per step template, lease TTLs (read 15m / write 45m / research 20m),
write-class concurrency 1, budget warn 60% / pause 100%, context-size warn 64KB / error
128KB, max_attempts 2 / max_fix_loops 2. Core ships with no opinions here.

## 9. Acceptance criteria (when implemented)

1. **Stranger test:** a human-only demo — a docs-review workflow with two steps, one
   fenced-command gate, no agents anywhere — is definable, runnable, and comprehensible
   from public docs alone, with zero references to AI concepts.
2. Zero model-made scheduling decisions in a full run: every transition in events
   traceable to next/gate/threshold/human input.
3. Capability proofs: an unclaimed worker cannot record (AUTH_ERROR); duplicates lose
   at claim (CONFLICT); late completes refused (STALE_LEASE); racing dispatchers cause
   no duplicate execution or lost updates.
4. Kill a worker mid-step: lease expiry alone re-readies it; the run completes; the
   attempt trail is complete.
5. Determinism: same run at same pins ⇒ identical step topology and byte-identical
   context bundles, immune to mid-run issue edits and working-tree changes.
6. Trust: a cloned malicious repo cannot cause execution without a prior local
   `trust add` (proof includes fenced-command harvesting); unmatched commands are
   reported, never run.
7. Budget: with reporting disabled, the run still pauses at the cap from the floor.
8. Compatibility: v4 DBs open; all existing verbs byte-compatible without `--json=v2`;
   a workflow-free repo shows no behavioral change on any existing verb.
9. Dispatch recovery: kill the relay with a dispatch open — TTL auto-abandon (or an
   explicit `dispatch abandon`) restores `next`; nothing is lost or double-executed.
10. Saga safety: crash at every stage boundary of `complete` — resume never
    double-runs a non-re-runnable gate (parks `waiting-human` instead), and a reaped
    write-class step cannot gain a successor until the reap is acknowledged.
11. Zero-touch: from `docket workflow init --template …` through a completed run,
    the only human inputs are conversational approvals relayed by the harness — no
    hand-edited config, no manual registration.

## 10. Staged delivery (ratified: Docket-first, staged)

Each stage ships as a normal Docket release, independently useful:

1. **Reliability delta** (§5) — immediate payoff for the current fleet.
2. **Claims/leases + capability tokens** on issues and steps-to-be.
3. **Workflows, steps, `next`, activation/pinning** — the engine's spine (largest
   stage; loop semantics land here).
4. **Gates + trust model** (§4).
5. **Payload schemas + ordered enums + action steps** (thresholds, reconcile-as-action).
6. **Runs, budgets/floor, report; `dispatch` manifests; the events *read* surface**
   (`events list --since`) — M4's AC-integrity audit needs it.
7. **Events `--follow` + prune** (observability tail).

Guard verbs land with their underlying features (`stop`/`gate` at stage 3,
`record`/`spawn` at stage 6); stage 3 carries the minimal run subset activation needs
(run row, status, pins) with report/budgets completing at stage 6.

**v1 shadow run (07 §4) becomes runnable after stage 6**; stage 7 may trail it. The
harness pieces (03) and Erik's instance config (05, 08) can be authored in parallel
from stage 2 onward.

## 11. Appendix: normative grammar and wire shapes

This section is the implementable definition of what §1–§2 describe. Field names are
final unless a stage's implementation review changes them; anything not listed here is
not part of the core surface.

### 11.1 Workflow definition grammar (TOML)

`[pipeline]` — `name` (string, required), `version` (int, required), `description?`.

`[match]` — `kind = [..]`, `labels_any = [..]`, `labels_all = [..]`,
`unless_labels = [..]`. Evaluated at activation; **exactly one** workflow may match an
issue — zero or multiple matches is a VALIDATION_ERROR naming the issue and the
candidate workflows.

`[limits]` — optional map of executor *class* → `{ max = N, lease_ttl = "45m" }` (bare
int = shorthand for `max`). When a run pins multiple workflows, the most restrictive
limit per class wins; unset values fall back to `docket config` defaults. Classes also carry `max_step_duration` — a schedule-to-close bound independent of
heartbeats, so a runaway executor cannot renew forever. (Erik's writer serialization
is exactly `"write" = { max = 1, lease_ttl = "45m", max_step_duration = "2h" }`.)

`[[step]]` fields:

| Field | Type / default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string, required, unique in workflow | step identity; instances are `name@k#i` (§11.3); the suffix `-held` is reserved for engine-materialized steps *(amended 2026-08-03, DKT-26)* |
| `executor` | string (opaque hint) | worker step; core never interprets the value |
| `action` | string (trusted command name) | deterministic computation step (§4) |
| `type` | `"human"` \| `"vote"` | operator gate / proposal-driven gate |
| — | | exactly one of `executor` / `action` / `type` / `fanout` per step |
| `fanout` | [executor hints] | expands to parallel siblings `name@k#0..n-1`, one per hint |
| `class` | string, default = executor value | concurrency-accounting key for `[limits]` |
| `emits` | artifact-kind string, required on executor steps | binds the step to its recorded artifact kind (`inputs` resolution; instance contract frontmatter mirrors it for the model's benefit — the workflow is authoritative) |
| `payload` | `schema@ver`, optional | payload validated at `complete`; threshold fields check against it at register time; required on `action = "aggregate"` steps *(amended 2026-08-03, DKT-25)* |
| `voters`, `vote_rule` | [executor hints], proposal-config name | required on `type="vote"` steps — who casts, which existing Docket threshold config tallies |
| `after` | [step names], **required** except the first step and `loop = true` steps (whose ordering comes from loop entry, §11.3) | intra-workflow predecessors; `[]` = root (implicit topology was a footgun) |
| `inputs` | [`"<step>.<kind>"` \| `"<step>.*"` \| `"issue.body"` \| `"issue.diff"`] | artifacts inlined into the context bundle, in order. `issue.diff` = the engine-computed VCS diff for the issue's scope, snapshotted and fingerprinted when its producing step completed (git in v1 — the one declared VCS coupling, §7) |
| `gates` | [trusted gate names \| `{name, source="fence:<tag>", pre=bool}`] | `pre = true` gates run at claim with results included in the context bundle (measure-then-judge steps); the rest run in order inside `complete` (§2, §4) |
| `params` | opaque KV table | arguments to `action` steps (e.g. the builtin `aggregate`) |
| `min_siblings` | int, default = all | fanout join quorum (§2 Fanout joins); the default is the plain join — quorum semantics (the `on_fail` routing at join) apply only when declared below the sibling count *(clarified 2026-08-03)* |
| `threshold` | table: routing → predicate (11.2) | routing computed over the step's recorded payloads |
| `on_fail` | `"fix-loop"` \| `"waiting-human"` \| `"skip"` \| `"abandon-issue"`; default `"waiting-human"` | routing for gate failure / attempts exhausted; `type="human"` steps must declare it explicitly and `"waiting-human"` is invalid there — reject routes per `on_fail` (§2's reject-routing rule; amended 2026-08-03) |
| `loop` | bool, default false | marks loop-body steps (11.3) |
| `after_loop` | step name | re-entry target after a loop body completes |
| `max_attempts` | int, default engine config | per-instance retry budget |
| `max_fix_loops` | int, default engine config | loop-entry budget per issue |
| `expected_cost` | number ≥ 0, default 0 | budget-floor contribution per claim (§2) |
| `when` | predicate over issue `kind`/`labels` | step is `skipped` when false |
| `metadata` | opaque KV table | recorded on the step; delivered in the context bundle |

### 11.2 Threshold predicates

`threshold` maps a routing (`"fix-loop"`, `"waiting-human"`, `"pass"`, or a step name)
to a predicate string, evaluated top-to-bottom, first match routes; no match ⇒ `"pass"`.
Routing to a **step name** interposes that declared, otherwise-unreached step as a
successor gate: it becomes ready next, and on its pass execution resumes at the
routing step's ordinary downstream (05 §2's security pipeline interposes its vote gate
this way). Grammar: `agg(field op literal)` where `agg ∈ {any, all, count>=n}` over
the payload array, `op ∈ {==, !=, >=, >, <=, <}`, and ordered comparisons are defined
**only** for fields whose registered schema declares `ordered_enum` (§2). Fields and literals are
validated against the registered schema at `workflow register` time. Example
(standard-change): `threshold = { "fix-loop" = "any(severity >= high)" }`.

### 11.3 Loop semantics (normative)

Step instances are identified `name@k#i` — `k` = loop ordinal (0 at initial
expansion), `#i` = fanout index (absent when not fanned out). When a routing resolves
to `"fix-loop"`: (1) the issue's loop counter increments; exceeding `max_fix_loops`
routes `waiting-human` instead — loops are bounded by construction. (2) Not-yet-claimed
instances downstream of `after_loop` (e.g. a pending `verify@0`) transition to the
terminal status **`superseded`** (event-logged); claimed/running instances finish, but
routing from a superseded lineage is inert. (3) Steps marked `loop = true` — excluded
from ordinary expansion — instantiate at ordinal `k`, with `inputs` bound within
ordinal `k` (falling back to the highest earlier ordinal per input), ordered by
(declared position, sibling index, artifact id) — never event order. (4) When the loop
body's gates pass, `after_loop` and its downstream chain re-instantiate at ordinal
`k`; gates re-run; thresholds re-apply. Issue completion is evaluated over
highest-ordinal instances only. Prior instances and artifacts remain immutable and
addressable; the ledger attributes every instance. There is no other loop construct.
Predecessor satisfaction and issue completion resolve per step name over instances at
the highest existing ordinal ≤ the consumer's (mirroring input binding);
re-instantiation never spans steps outside the `after_loop` chain. *(Clarified
2026-08-03, S3 stage review.)*

Engine-enforced numbers live core-side, never in opaque pins: per-class lease TTLs and
concurrency (`[limits]` / `docket config`), attempt caps (step fields / config
defaults), the per-run budget cap (`docket run start --budget N`, config default), and
context-size warn/error caps (config). Opaque instance files may carry anything else.

`instance` is the rendered `name@k#i` identity (§11.3) carried alongside the `STEP-N`
id on next rows and, via `context.step`, in the context bundle *(added 2026-08-03,
DKT-15)*. `pre_gates?` is an array of §11.4-shaped gate results for the step's
`pre = true` gates, present only when the step declares them; `reason?` carries why
a verdict is `unmatched` or timed out, null on ordinary pass/fail *(added
2026-08-03, DKT-19 / DKT-20)*.

`docket step context STEP-N` re-emits `context` read-only (no token required; local
inspection). `--meta` on it reports per-section byte counts — the closure-size record
(02 §8).
